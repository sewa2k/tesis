abstract = {Amoebic gill disease (AGD) is a disease caused by the ectoparasite Neoparamoeba perurans which affects several cultured marine fish worldwide. The characterisation of pro-inflammatory and immune related genes at the mRNA level in AGD-affected Atlantic salmon gills was performed at 10 days post-inoculation using 2D quantitative RT-PCR, a method of mapping transcriptional responses in tissues. The genes of interest were IL-1$\beta$, TNF-$\alpha$, TCR-$\alpha$ chain, CD8, CD4, MHC-II$\alpha$, MHC-I, IgM and IgT. A significant increase in expression of the mRNA of all the genes was observed in the gills of AGD-affected fish. Contrary to previous studies, our data suggest that the parasite, N. perurans, elicits a classical inflammatory response in the gills of AGD-affected fish and indicates that the mRNA expression of immune genes within gill lesions misrepresents the cellular immune response in the gills during AGD.},

abstract = {Information on the ontogeny of the fish immune system is largely restricted to a few species of teleosts (e.g., rainbow trout, catfish, zebrafish, sea bass) and has previously focused on morphological features. However, basic questions including the identification of the first lympho-hematopoietic sites, the origin of T- and B-lymphocytes and the acquisition of full immunological capacities remain to be resolved. We review these three main topics with special emphasis on recent results obtained from the zebrafish, a new experimental model particularly suitable for study of the ontogeny of the immune system because of its rapid development and easy manipulation. This species also provides an easy way of creating mutations that can be detected by various types of screens. In some teleosts (i.e., angelfish) the first blood cells are formed in the yolk sac. In others, such as zebrafish, the first hematopoietic site is an intraembryonic locus, the intermediate cell mass (ICM), whereas in both killifish and rainbow trout the first blood cells appear for a short time in the yolk sac but later the ICM becomes the main hematopoietic area. Erythrocytes and macrophages are the first blood cells to be identified in zebrafish embryos. They occur in the ICM, the duct of Cuvier and the peripheral circulation. Between 24 and 30 hour post-fertilization (hpf) at a temperature of 28 degrees C a few myeloblasts and myelocytes appear between the yolk sac and the body walls, and the ventral region of the tail of 1-2 day-old zebrafish also contains developing blood cells. The thymus, kidney and spleen are the major lymphoid organs of teleosts. The thymus is the first organ to become lymphoid, although earlier the kidney can contain hematopoietic precursors but not lymphocytes. In freshwater, but not in marine, teleosts the spleen is the last organ to acquire that condition. We and other authors have demonstrated an early expression of Rag-1 in the zebrafish thymus that correlates well with the morphological identification of lymphoid cells. On the other hand, the origins and time of appearance of B lymphocytes in teleosts are a matter of discussion and recent results are summarized here. The functioning rather than the mere morphological evidence of lymphocytes determines when the full immunocompetence in fish is attained. Information on the histogenesis of fish lymphoid organs can also be obtained by analysing zebrafish mutants with defects in the development of immune progenitors and/or in the maturation of non-lymphoid stromal elements of the lymphoid organs. The main characteristics of some of these mutants will also be described.},

Here we summarize current knowledge for both synthetic vesicle experiments and microbe experiments, with a focus on comparisons between the two. Microbial experiments are done at peptide to lipid ratios that are at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than vesicle-based experiments. To close the gap between the two concentration regimes, we propose an "interfacial activity model", which is based on an experimentally testable molecular image of AMP-membrane interactions. The interfacial activity model may be useful in driving engineering and design of novel AMPs.},

The greater the distance from the equator the more profound this influence becomes, as the environment becomes more variable over the years. Temperature, photoperiod, precipitation and other environmental conditions, which are directly or indirectly controlled by the season, can affect an animal. It is becoming apparent that these conditions may impact on the immune system, and this can affect animal health. This review looks at the known mechanisms for transducing environmental cues and how these can affect immune parameters and function. The main focus is fish, especially in relation to aquaculture and the associated disease risks. Work on other animal classes is included for comparison.},

Based on light and scanning electron microscopy examination, the new species differs from most other gonad-infecting Philometra spp. in the length of spicules (126-135 $\mu$m), a gubernaculum with dorsal lamella-like structures on its distal end, and the number and arrangement of genital papillae in the male. From a few congeneric, gonad-infecting species with unknown males, it can be distinguished by some morphological and biometrical features found in gravid female (absence of caudal projections, length of first-stage larvae or oesophagus, moderately developed anterior oesophageal inflation) and by the host type (fish family) and geographical distribution. P. genypteri is the first philometrid species reported from a fish belonging to the order Ophidiiformes and the second nominal species of Philometra recorded from marine fishes of the eastern South Pacific.},

The rainbow trout rIL-8 was produced in Escherichia coli and purified using a 6xHis tag at the N-terminus. The rIL-8 induced a dose-dependent migration of head kidney leukocytes at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 ng/ml, with a peak response at 1 ng/ml. Trout rIL-8 also had a significant effect on superoxide production by head kidney cells, with maximal activity at 0.1 and 1 ng/ml. When injected intraperitoneally into trout, rIL-8 had a clear effect on total leukocyte number in the peritoneal cavity, with increasing doses (up to 5 microg) eliciting more cells. Of three leukocyte types distinguished, neutrophils were the dominant cell type, especially at higher rIL-8 concentrations. In contrast, the proportion of macrophages and lymphocytes decreased with rIL-8 administration, suggesting that they were not attracted at the same rate as neutrophils.},

@article{Alvarez-Pellitero2008,
abstract = {The increasing economic importance of fish parasitoses for aquaculture and fisheries has enhanced the interest in the defence mechanisms against these infections. Both innate and adaptive immune responses are mounted by fish to control parasite infections, and several mechanisms described for mammalian parasitoses have also been demonstrated in teleosts. Innate immune initiation relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pathogen recognizing receptors (PRRs). A number of PRRs, mainly Toll-like receptors (TLRs), have been characterized in fish, and some molecules susceptible of functioning as PAMPs are known for some fish parasites. A lectin-carbohydrate interaction has also been described in some host fish-parasite systems, thus probably involving C-type lectin receptors. Inflammatory reactions involving cellular reactions, as phagocytosis and phagocyte activity (including oxidative mechanisms), as well as complement activity, are modulated by many fish parasites, including mainly ciliates, flagellates and myxozoans. Besides complement, a number of humoral immune factors (peroxidases, lysozyme, acute-phase proteins) are also implicated in the response to some parasites. Among adaptive responses, most data deal with the presence of B lymphocytes and the production of specific antibodies (Abs). Although an increasing number of T-cell markers have been described for teleosts, the specific characterization of those involved in their response is far from being obtained. Gene expression studies have demonstrated the involvement of other mediators of the innate and adaptive responses, i.e., cytokines [interleukins (IL-1, IL-8), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)], chemokines (CXC, CC), as well as several oxidative enzymes [inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2)]. Information is scarcer for factors more directly linked to adaptive responses, such as major histocompatibility (MH) receptors, T cell receptors (TCRs) and IgM. Expression of some immune genes varied according to the phase of infection, and proinflammatory cytokines were mainly activated in the early stages. Gene expression was generally higher in the target tissues for some skin and gill parasites, as Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Neoparamoeba spp. and Lepeophtheirus salmonis, thus confirming the relevance of mucosal immunity in these infections. The existence of protective responses has been demonstrated for several fish parasites, both in natural infections and in immunization studies. Most information on the mechanisms involved in protection deals with the production of specific Abs. Nevertheless, their levels are not always correlated to protection, and the precise involvement of immune mechanisms in the response is unknown in many cases. No commercial vaccine is currently available for piscine parasitoses, although experimental vaccines have been assayed against I. multifiliis, Cryptobia salmositica and scuticociliates. The known information points to the need for integrated studies of the mechanisms involved in protection, in order to choose the optimum antigen candidates, adjuvants and formulations.},

We prepared acid soluble collagens (ASC) from hoki and ling skins, and analyzed their thermal denaturation properties using a Rapid Visco™ Analyzer. At slower heating rates the denaturation temperature (TD) of hoki and ling collagens decreased. This result is consistent with the model of irreversible rate kinetics for the denaturation of collagen. We determined the effects of solvents that disrupt hydrogen bonding on ASC stability. Increasing concentrations of urea from 0.1 M to 1.0 M and acetic acid from 0.1 M to 0.5 M decreased TD. This resulted from the effects of these reagents on the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the collagen triple helix.},

abstract = {Cxcl8 is a pro-inflammatory chemokine, best known for its role in neutrophil chemotaxis. Signalling through its receptors, Cxcr1 and Cxcr2, is induced by inflammatory stimuli evoked by microbial, chemical or environmental stress, and hormonal signals. While it is recognised that Cxcl8 signalling is active in the gut mucosa, this is not as well understood as its role in leukocyte trafficking. Here, we report the characterisation of genes encoding the zebrafish Cxcl8, Cxcr1 and Cxcr2. By a combination of genomic, expression and functional analyses, we show that the Cxcl8 signalling pathway is conserved in zebrafish. As in humans, cxcl8 is expressed in zebrafish leukocytes. Transcripts were also detected in intestinal epithelial cells, and this expression is upregulated under inflammatory conditions caused by bacterial or chemical insult. Expression of cxcr1 and cxcr2 is robust within the developing gut. This work provides a model for the study of Cxcl8 signalling during gut inflammation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rainbow trout are important fish for aquaculture and recreational fisheries and serves as a model species for research investigations associated with carcinogenesis, comparative immunology, toxicology and evolutionary biology. However, to date there is no genome reference sequence to facilitate the development of molecular technologies that utilize high-throughput characterizations of gene expression and genetic variation. Alternatively, transcriptome sequencing is a rapid and efficient means for gene discovery and genetic marker development. Although a large number (258,973) of EST sequences are publicly available, the nature of rainbow trout duplicated genome hinders assembly and complicates annotation.

RESULTS: High-throughput deep sequencing of the Swanson rainbow trout doubled-haploid transcriptome using 454-pyrosequencing technology yielded \~{}1.3 million reads with an average length of 344 bp, a total of 447 million bases. De novo assembly of the sequences yielded 151,847 Tentative Consensus (TC) sequences (average length of 662 bp) and 224,391 singletons. A combination assembly of both the 454-pyrosequencing ESTs and the pre-existing sequences resulted in 161,818 TCs (average length of 758 bp) and 261,071 singletons. Gene Ontology analysis of the combination assembly showed high similarities to transcriptomes of other fish species with known genome sequences.

CONCLUSION: The 454 library significantly increased the suite of ESTs available for rainbow trout, allowing improved assembly and annotation of the transcriptome. Furthermore, the 454 sequencing enables functional genome research in rainbow trout, providing a wealth of sequence data to serve as a reference transcriptome for future studies including identification of paralogous sequences and/or allelic variation, digital gene expression and proteomic research.},

abstract = {We report the cloning of a novel antimicrobial peptide gene, termed rtCATH\_1, found in the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. The predicted 216-residue rtCATH\_1 prepropeptide consists of three domains: a 22-residue signal peptide, a 128-residue cathelin-like region containing two identifiable cathelicidin family signatures, and a predicted 66-residue C-terminal cationic antimicrobial peptide. This predicted mature peptide was unique in possessing features of different known (mammalian) cathelicidin subgroups, such as the cysteine-bridged family and the specific amino-acid-rich family. The rtCATH\_1 gene comprises four exons, as seen in all known mammalian cathelicidin genes, and several transcription factor binding sites known to be of relevance to host defenses were identified in the 5' flanking region. By Northern blot analysis, the expression of rtCATH\_1 was detected in gill, head kidney, and spleen of bacterially challenged fish. Primary cultures of head kidney leukocytes from rainbow trout stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or poly(I x C) also expressed rtCATH\_1. A 36-residue peptide corresponding to the core part of the fish cathelicidin was chemically synthesized and shown to exhibit potent antimicrobial activity and a low hemolytic effect. Thus, rtCATH\_1 represents a novel antimicrobial peptide gene belonging to the cathelicidin family and may play an important role in the innate immunity of rainbow trout.},

abstract = {Interleukins are a subgroup of cytokines, molecules involved in the intercellular regulation of the immune system. The term interleukin was first coined in 1979 to refer to molecules that signal between different leucocyte types, although not exclusively restricted to leucocyte communication. Whilst it is now known that interleukins are produced by a wide variety of cell types, nevertheless many are synthesised by CD4(+) T helper cells, macrophages/monocytes and endothelial cells. The nomenclature is relatively straightforward, with interleukin 1 the first discovered and interleukin 2 the second, etc. However, whilst 35 interleukins are currently described in mammals, several are in fact terms referring to subfamilies of more molecules, as with the IL-1 family where 11 members (IL-1F1-IL-1F11) are present, and the IL-17 family where 6 members (IL-17A-IL-17F) are present. So the total is much higher and splice variants and allelic variation increase this diversity further. This review will focus on what is known about interleukins in fish, and will refer to the major subfamilies rather than try to work through 35 descriptions in a row. It is clear that many direct homologues of molecules known in mammals are present in fish, but that not all are present and some novel interleukins exist that may have arisen from fish specific gene duplication events.},

abstract = {We have previously observed that in common carp (Cyprinus carpio), administration of $\beta$-glucan (MacroGard®) as feed additive leads to a lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggesting that this immunostimulant may be preventing an acute and potentially dangerous response to infection, particularly in the gut. However, in general, mechanisms to detect and eliminate pathogens must also be induced in order to achieve an efficient clearance of the infection. Protection against viral diseases acquired through $\beta$-glucan-supplemented feed has been extensively reported for several experimental models in fish but the underlining mechanisms are still unknown. Thus, in order to better characterize the antiviral action induced by $\beta$-glucans in fish, MacroGard® was administered daily to common carp in the form of supplemented commercial food pellets. Carp were fed for a period of 25 days prior to intra-peritoneal injection with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a well-known double-stranded RNA mimic that triggers a type-I interferon (IFN) response. Subsequently, a set of immune related genes, including mx, were analysed by real-time PCR on liver, spleen, head kidney and mid gut tissues. Results obtained confirmed that treatment with $\beta$-glucan alone generally down-regulated the mRNA expression of selected cytokines when compared to untreated fish, while mx gene expression remained stable or was slightly up-regulated. Injection with poly(I:C) induced a similar down-regulated gene expression pattern for cytokines in samples from $\beta$-glucan fed fish. In contrast, poly(I:C) injection markedly increased mx gene expression in samples from $\beta$-glucan fed fish but hardly in samples from fish fed control feed. In an attempt to explain the high induction of mx, we studied Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene expression in these carp. TLR3 is a prototypical pattern recognition receptor considered important for the binding of viral double-stranded RNA and triggering of a type-I IFN response. Through genome data mining, two sequences for carp tlr3 were retrieved (tlr3.1 and tlr3.2) and characterized. Constitutive gene expression of both tlr3.1 and tlr3.2 was detected by real-time PCR in cDNA of all analysed carp organs. Strikingly, 25 days after $\beta$-glucan feeding, very high levels of tlr3.1 gene expression were observed in all analysed organs, with the exception of the liver. Our data suggest that $\beta$-glucan-mediated protection against viral diseases could be due to an increased Tlr3-mediated recognition of ligands, resulting in an increased antiviral activity of Mx.},

abstract = {Potential immunostimulatory effects of orally administered $\beta$-glucan were investigated in combination with immersion vaccination against enteric redmouth disease caused by Yersinia ruckeri in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A linear, unbranched and pure (purity ≥98\%) $\beta$-1,3-glucan (syn. paramylon) from the alga Euglena gracilis was applied at an inclusion level of 1\% $\beta$-glucan in feed administered at a rate of 1\% biomass day(-1) for 84 consecutive days. Fish were vaccinated after two weeks of experimental feeding and bath challenged with live Y. ruckeri six weeks post-vaccination. Blood and head kidney were sampled at day 0, 13 (1 day pre-vaccination), 15, 55, 59 (day 3 post-challenge (p.c.)), 70 and 84. Vaccination induced significantly increased survival p.c., whereas the $\beta$-glucan had no effect on survival in either unvaccinated or vaccinated fish. Expression in head kidney of genes related to the acute phase response, i.e. interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$), serum amyloid A (SAA), precerebellin, and hepcidin, was significantly different in vaccinated fish receiving $\beta$-glucan compared to vaccinated controls at day 3 p.c., while no effect of $\beta$-glucan was observed among unvaccinated fish. Significant interaction between $\beta$-glucan and vaccination was found for the regulation of IL-1$\beta$, tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$, interferon-$\gamma$, SAA, precerebellin and hepcidin p.c. For SAA, the significant effect of $\beta$-glucan in vaccinated fish persisted at day 14 p.c. and 28 p.c. The difference in gene expression among vaccinated fish was mainly observed as down-regulations in vaccinated, $\beta$-glucan fed fish compared to up-regulations or no regulation in vaccinated controls. Slightly increased levels of plasma lysozyme activity were found in fish (both unvaccinated and vaccinated) receiving $\beta$-glucan at day 3 p.c. compared to control fed groups. This was associated with a faster clearance of Y. ruckeri in unvaccinated fish receiving $\beta$-glucan. In contrast to the trend towards a beneficial effect of $\beta$-glucan on plasma lysozyme activity, a trend towards suppression of plasma antibodies was seen in both unvaccinated and vaccinated fish receiving $\beta$-glucan. However, the effects of $\beta$-glucan were not reflected in the survival curves, and the differences seen in plasma lysozyme activity and antibody levels may have counteracted and set off each other as well as counteracted any potential effect represented by the differences in gene expression found.},

abstract = {Gene-encoded anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) are widespread in nature, as they are synthesized by microorganisms as well as by multicellular organisms from both the vegetal and the animal kingdoms. These naturally occurring AMPs form a first line of host defense against pathogens and are involved in innate immunity. Depending on their tissue distribution, AMPs ensure either a systemic or a local protection of the organism against environmental pathogens. They are classified into three major groups: (i) peptides with an alpha-helical conformation (insect cecropins, magainins, etc.), (ii) cyclic and open-ended cyclic peptides with pairs of cysteine residues (defensins, protegrin, etc.), and (iii) peptides with an over-representation of some amino acids (proline rich, histidine rich, etc.). Most AMPs display hydrophobic and cationic properties, have a molecular mass below 25-30 kDa, and adopt an amphipathic structure (alpha-helix, beta-hairpin-like beta-sheet, beta-sheet, or alpha-helix/beta-sheet mixed structures) that is believed to be essential to their anti-microbial action. Interestingly, in recent years, a series of novel AMPs have been discovered as processed forms of large proteins. Despite the extreme diversity in their primary and secondary structures, all natural AMPs have the in vitro particularity to affect a large number of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, yeast, virus, etc.) with identical or complementary activity spectra. This review focuses on AMPs forming alpha-helices, beta-hairpin-like beta-sheets, beta-sheets, or alpha-helix/beta-sheet mixed structures from invertebrate and vertebrate origins. These molecules show some promise for therapeutic use.},

These maternally-transferred factors include IgM, lysozymes, lectin, cathelicidin and complement components. Recently, yolk proteins, phosvitin and lipovitellin, have been shown to be maternally-transferred factors, functioning in the defense of teleost larvae against pathogens. Among these factors, the mode of action of complement components and yolk proteins has been explored, whereas that of all the other factors remains elusive. At present, the transfer mechanisms of maternally-derived immune factors are largely unknown although those of IgM and yolk protein transmission from mother to offspring have been reported in some fishes. Maternal transfer of immunity is affected by many elements, including biological factors, such as age and maturation, and environmental conditions experienced by brood fish, such as pathogens and nutritional supply. Practically, the manipulation of maternal immunity transfer can be used to enhance the survival rate of fish larvae.},

abstract = {In recent years, aquaculture research has focused on probiotics, prebiotics, and $\beta$-glucans, in order to improve health status and growth performance. Information regarding the effects of $\beta$-glucan on growth performance and intestinal immunity of mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) is scarce. An experiment was therefore conducted to investigate the effects of a yeast $\beta$-glucan preparation (MacroGard(®) ) on growth performance, intestinal morphology and haemato-immunological indices of mirror carp. Carp (initial weight 11.1 ± 0.0 g) were fed highly purified diets supplemented with 0\% (control), 0.1\%, 1\% or 2\% MacroGard(®) for 8 weeks. Fish fed diets containing 1\% and 2\% MacroGard(®) showed significant improvements in weight gain, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio compared to fish fed both the control and the 0.1\% MacroGard(®) containing diet. Histological appraisal of the intestine showed a significantly higher infiltration of leucocytes into the epithelial layer of fish fed diets supplemented with 1\% and 2\% MacroGard(®) in the anterior intestine compared to fish fed the control and 0.1\% MacroGard(®) diet. This effect was not observed in the posterior intestine. There were no significant differences in the intestinal absorptive surface area and number of goblet cells in either intestinal region. At the end of the experiment, the haematological status of the fish was examined. Compared to control fed fish, the haematocrit value was significantly elevated in fish fed the 2\% MacroGard(®) diet. Furthermore, the blood monocyte fraction was significantly higher in fish fed the 1\% and 2\% MacroGard(®) diets. No significant changes were observed in the other blood parameters assessed. The present study shows that high dietary $\beta$-glucan inclusion increases growth performance without detrimental effects on the health indicators assessed. Increased intraepithelial leucocytes in the anterior intestine may indicate a localized immune response; no detrimental effects on intestinal morphology were observed.},

Groups of fish (average weight = 10-15 g) were immunized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.1 ml of subcellular materials, i.e., 0.2 ± 0.05 mg protein per fish, comprising extracellular proteins (ECPs), cell wall proteins (CWPs) and whole cell proteins (WCPs) of SM1 and SM2, respectively, or with 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to serve as the control. Seven days after administration, fish from each group were challenged i.p. with 0.1 ml of a suspension in PBS of 3 × 10(5) cells ml(-1) per fish of Vibrio anguillarum. Use of CWPs and WCPs demonstrated significantly (P < 0.05) better protection against V. anguillarum insofar as mortalities were reduced to 11-17\% [relative percent survival (RPS) = 80-87\%], although ECPs fared less well (mortalities = 33-38\%; RPS = 56-62\%; P > 0.05), compared to 86\% mortalities of the controls. The mode of action reflected activation of innate immune factors by CWPs and WCPs, demonstrating significantly (P < 0.05) increased expression of respiratory burst (optical density; OD(550 nm)) from 0.039 to 0.043-0.045, peroxidase (OD(550 nm)) from 0.26 to 0.37-0.55, and bacterial killing activities (i.e., percentage of surviving bacteria reduced from 79\% to 56-57\% for SM2).

This is the first isolation of a cathelicidin from teleost fish. The mature cathelicidin was found to be a 67-residues peptide, highly cationic with a pI of 13. Reversed phase chromatographic fractions containing the purified peptide had pronounced antimicrobial activity and the activity of the mature peptide was confirmed using a synthetic peptide. We examined the expression of cathelicidin during cod larvae early development using real-time PCR and detected expression that varied in the course of the first 68 days post hatching (dph). Two groups of larvae having a different food regime were compared. Cathelicidin expression was found to differ between the two groups and this could be linked to their food input. The presence and rapid adjustment of cathelicidin expression in the larvae indicate that the immune system of cod is active from early on in development and responds to external stimuli by the production of antimicrobial peptides.},

abstract = {Amoebic gill disease (AGD) is an ectoparasitic disease caused by infection with the protozoan Neoparamoeba sp. and is characterised by epithelial hyperplasia that manifests as gill lesions. In order to examine the nature of the immune response to AGD, the expression of a range of immune-regulatory genes was examined in na\"{\i}ve uninfected rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and na\"{\i}ve rainbow trout subjected to a laboratory-induced AGD infection. The immune-regulatory genes examined were interleukin-1 beta isoform 1 (IL-1beta1), tumour necrosis factor alpha isoforms 1 and 2 (TNF-alpha1, TNF-alpha2), interleukin-8 (IL-8), transforming growth factor beta isoform 1 (TGF-beta1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), major histocompatibility complex beta chain (MHC-II beta-chain) and T-cell receptor beta chain (TCR beta-chain). Immune-regulatory genes that were up/down-regulated in AGD-infected trout compared to uninfected controls at 0, 7, and 14 days post-inoculation (p.i.) in gill, liver and anterior kidney tissue were initially identified by means of semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Up/down-regulated immune-regulatory genes were subsequently quantitated and validated by real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The extent of AGD-associated pathology was consistent amongst all AGD-infected trout at 7 days p.i. and increased considerably by 14 days p.i. At both 7 and 14 days p.i. IL-1beta1 and iNOS gene expression was significantly up-regulated in the gills, and IL-8 was significantly up-regulated in the liver of AGD-infected trout at 7 days p.i. These data demonstrate the involvement of the immune response to AGD at the molecular level, and indicate the importance of this response at the site of infection and the possible involvement of a systemic immune response.},

abstract = {The zebrafish holds much promise as a high-throughput drug screening model for immune-related diseases, including inflammatory and infectious diseases and cancer. This is due to the excellent possibilities for in vivo imaging in combination with advanced tools for genomic and large scale mutant analysis. The context of the embryo's developing immune system makes it possible to study the contribution of different immune cell types to disease progression. Furthermore, due to the temporal separation of innate immunity from adaptive responses, zebrafish embryos and larvae are particularly useful for dissecting the innate host factors involved in pathology. Recent studies have underscored the remarkable similarity of the zebrafish and human immune systems, which is important for biomedical applications. This review is focused on the use of zebrafish as a model for infectious diseases, with emphasis on bacterial pathogens. Following a brief overview of the zebrafish immune system and the tools and methods used to study host-pathogen interactions in zebrafish, we discuss the current knowledge on receptors and downstream signaling components that are involved in the zebrafish embryo's innate immune response. We summarize recent insights gained from the use of bacterial infection models, particularly the Mycobacterium marinum model that illustrate the potential of the zebrafish model for high-throughput antimicrobial drug screening.},

abstract = {Two separate experiments were conducted with hybrid striped bass to evaluate four potential prebiotics: GroBiotic-A (partially autolyzed brewer's yeast, dairy ingredient components, and fermentation products), mannanoligosaccharide (MOS), galactooligosaccharide (GOS), and inulin. In the in vitro experiment, intestinal contents were incubated with the individual prebiotics (0.5\% by weight) at 25 degrees C for 24 and 48 h. Analysis of volatile fatty acids in the supernatant showed that GroBiotic-A, MOS, and GOS tended to produce lower acetate levels but higher butyrate levels at 48 h compared to diet alone. However, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis failed to detect any differences in the composition of the microbial community among treatments. DNA sequencing of a common band for all inoculated samples revealed close similarity to the anaerobic Fusobacteria bacterium. An 8-week feeding trial also was conducted to evaluate the four prebiotics looking at growth performance; weight gain, feed efficiency ratio, protein efficiency ratio, whole-body ash, moisture, and lipid did not vary among fish fed the various diets. However, DGGE analysis revealed that all prebiotics produced a different type of microbial community in the intestinal tract of hybrid striped bass compared to fish fed the basal diet. Thus, GroBiotic-A, FOS, GOS, and MOS exhibited prebiotic effects in hybrid striped bass.},

@article{Storici1996,
abstract = {Cathelicidins are a novel family of antimicrobial peptide precursors from mammalian myeloid cells. They are characterized by a conserved N-terminal region while the C-terminal antimicrobial domain can vary considerably in both primary sequence and length. Four cathelicidins, proBac5, proBac7, prododecapeptide and proBMAP-28, have been concurrently purified from bovine neutrophils, using simple and rapid methodologies. The correlation of ES-MS data from the purified proteins with their cDNA-deduced sequences has revealed several common features of their primary sequence, such as the presence of N-terminal 5-oxoproline (pyroglutamate) residues and two disulfide bridges in a 1-2, 3-4 arrangement. The N-terminal domains of the cathelicidins present one or two Asp-Pro bonds, which are particularly acid-labile in proBac5 and proBac7, but stable in prododecapeptide. This suggests that the spatial organization around these bonds may vary in different cathelicidins, and favour hydrolysis in some cases. An unexpected feature of the prododecapeptide is that it exists as dimers formed by three possible combinations of its two isoforms. The isolation of a truncated, monomeric form of this protein, lacking the cysteine-containing antimicrobial dodecapeptide, indicates that dimerization occurs via disulfide bridge formation at the level of the C-terminal domain and that the dodecapeptide is likely released as a dimer from its precursor. Sequence-based secondary structure predictions and CD results indicate for cathelicidins a 30-50\% content of extended conformation and <20\% content of alpha-helical conformation, with the alpha-helical segment placed near the N-terminus. Finally, similarity searching and topology-based structure prediction underline a significant sequential and structural similarity between the conserved N-terminal domain of cathelicidins and cystatin-like domains, placing this family within the cystatin superfamily. When assayed against cathepsin L, unlike the potent cystatin inhibitors, three of the four cathelicidins show only a poor inhibitory activity (Ki = 0.6-3 microM).},

abstract = {Host immune responses elicited by invading pathogens depend on recognition of the pathogen by specific receptors present on phagocytic cells. However, the reactions to viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal pathogens vary according to the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the surface of the invader. Phagocytic cells are known to initiate a respiratory burst following an exposure to the pathogen, but the underlying and associated specific elements are poorly elucidated in fish. The present study describes the differential response of head kidney leukocytes from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to different PAMPs mimicking viral (poly I:C), bacterial (flagellin and LPS) and fungal infections (zymosan and $\beta$-glucan). Transcript of cytokines related to inflammation (IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-$\alpha$) was highly up-regulated following LPS exposure whereas flagellin or poly I:C induced merely moderate reactions. In contrast, IFN-$\gamma$ expression was significantly higher in the poly I:C stimulated group compared to the LPS group. When head kidney cells were exposed to zymosan or $\beta$-glucan, genes encoding IL-1$\beta$, TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6 and IL-10 became up-regulated. Their level of up-regulation was comparable to LPS but the kinetics differed. In particular, TNF-$\alpha$ induction was considerably slower when stimulated with zymosan or $\beta$-glucan. The gene encoding the COX-2 enzyme, a central element during initiation of inflammatory reactions, was significantly higher in stimulated cells although a depressing effect of high concentrations of LPS and zymosan became evident after 4h exposure. This study suggests that rainbow trout leukocytes respond differently to viral, bacterial and fungal PAMPs, which may reflect activation of specific signaling cascades eventually leading to activation of different immune effector molecules.},

abstract = {The effect of $\beta$-glucan as a feed additive on the serum and gene profile of C-reactive protein (CRP) and complement acute phase responses was ascertained in common carp Cyprinus carpio. In addition effects of subsequent intraperitoneal injections of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), i.e. LPS or poly(I:C), to mimic bacterial or viral infection respectively, were studied. Carp were first orally fed with $\beta$-glucan (MacroGard(®)) with a daily $\beta$-glucan intake of 6 mg per kg body weight or with control food for 25 days and then injected with PBS containing either LPS (4 mg/kg) or poly(I:C) (5 mg/kg) or PBS alone. Fish were sampled during the 25 days of the feeding period and up to 7 days post-PAMPs injections for serum and liver, head kidney and mid-gut tissues. Oral administration of $\beta$-glucan for 25 days significantly increased serum CRP levels and alternative complement activity (ACP). In addition, the subsequent LPS and poly(I:C) challenges significantly affected CRP and complement related gene expression profiles (crp1, crp2, c1r/s, bf/c2, c3 and masp2), with the greatest effects observed in the $\beta$-glucan fed fish. However, in fish fed $\beta$-glucan the PAMPs injections had less effects on CRP levels and complement activity in the serum than in control fed fish, suggesting that the 25 days of $\beta$-glucan immunostimulation was sufficient enough to reduce the effects of LPS and poly(I:C) injections. Results suggest that MacroGard(®) stimulated CRP and complement responses to PAMPs immunological challenges in common carp thus highlighting the beneficial $\beta$-glucan immunostimulant properties.},

abstract = {Dominant bacterial microbiota of the gut of juvenile farmed Atlantic salmon was investigated using a combination of molecular approaches. Bacterial community composition from the stomach, the pyloric caeca, and the intestine was assessed by extracting DNA directly from each gut compartment. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplicons showed very similar bacterial compositions throughout the digestive tract. Band sequencing revealed a narrow diversity of species with a dominance of Pseudomonas in the three compartments. However, cloning revealed more diversity among the Pseudomonas sequences. To confirm these results, we analyzed the bacterial community by amplifying the variable 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ITS). Similar ITS profiles were observed among gastrointestinal compartments of salmon, confirming the TTGE results. Moreover, the dominant ITS band at 650 bp, identified as Pseudomonas, was observed in the ITS profile from fish collected in two seasons (July 2003 and 2004). In contrast, aerobic culture analysis revealed Shewanella spp. as the most prevalent isolate. This discrepancy was resolved by evaluating 16S rDNA and ITS polymerase chain reaction amplification efficiency from both Shewanella and Pseudomonas isolates. Very similar efficiencies were observed in the two bacteria. Hence, this discrepancy may be explained by preferential cultivation of Shewanella spp. under the experimental conditions. Also, we included analyses of pelleted feed and the water influent to explore environmental influences on the bacterial composition of the gut microbiota. Overall, these results indicate a homogeneous composition of the bacterial community composition along the gastrointestinal tract of reared juvenile salmon. This community is mainly composed of Pseudomonas spp., which could be derived from water influent and may be selectively associated with salmon in this hatchery.},

abstract = {Divergent life history strategies occur in steelhead or rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, and many populations produce both migrant (anadromous fish that move to the ocean after rearing) and resident (do not migrate and remain in fresh water) individuals. Mechanisms leading to each type are only partially understood; while the general tendency of a population is heritable, individual tendency may be plastic, influenced by local environment. Steelhead hatchery programmes aim to mitigate losses in wild stocks by producing trout that will migrate to the ocean and not compete with wild trout for limited freshwater resources. To increase our understanding of gill function in these migratory or resident phenotypes, here we compare gill transcriptome profiles of hatchery-released fish either at the release site (residents) or five river kilometres downstream while still in full fresh water (migrants). To test whether any of these genes can be used as predictive markers for smoltification, we compared these genes between migrant-like and undifferentiated trout while still in the hatchery in a common environment (prerelease). Results confirmed the gradual process of smoltification, and the importance of energetics, gill remodelling and ion transport capacity for migrants. Additionally, residents overexpressed transcripts involved in antiviral defences, potentially for immune surveillance via dendritic cells in the gills. The best smoltification marker candidate was protein s100a4, expression of which was highly correlated with Na(+) , K(+) ATPase (NKA) activity and smolt-like morphology in pre- and postrelease trout gills.},

abstract = {Healthy oysters are inhabited by abundant microbial communities that vary with environmental conditions and coexist with immunocompetent cells in the circulatory system. In Crassostrea gigas oysters, the antimicrobial response, which is believed to control pathogens and commensals, relies on potent oxygen-dependent reactions and on antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs) produced at low concentrations by epithelial cells and/or circulating hemocytes. In non-diseased oysters, hemocytes express basal levels of defensins (Cg-Defs) and proline-rich peptides (Cg-Prps). When the bacterial load dramatically increases in oyster tissues, both AMP families are driven to sites of infection by major hemocyte movements, together with bactericidal permeability/increasing proteins (Cg-BPIs) and given forms of big defensins (Cg-BigDef), whose expression in hemocytes is induced by infection. Co-localization of AMPs at sites of infection could be determinant in limiting invasion as synergies take place between peptide families, a phenomenon which is potentiated by the considerable diversity of AMP sequences. Besides, diversity occurs at the level of oyster AMP mechanisms of action, which range from membrane lysis for Cg-BPI to inhibition of metabolic pathways for Cg-Defs. The combination of such different mechanisms of action may account for the synergistic activities observed and compensate for the low peptide concentrations in C. gigas cells and tissues. To overcome the oyster antimicrobial response, oyster pathogens have developed subtle mechanisms of resistance and evasion. Thus, some Vibrio strains pathogenic for oysters are equipped with AMP-sensing systems that trigger resistance. More generally, the known oyster pathogenic vibrios have evolved strategies to evade intracellular killing through phagocytosis and the associated oxidative burst.},

abstract = {Enteromyxum scophthalmi is the causative agent of turbot enteromyxosis, an intestinal parasitisation that produces severe desquamative enteritis leading to a cachectic syndrome and eventually the death. It is well known the importance of the innate immune response against parasites in fish, with the release of antimicrobial substances such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, produced by the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). This enzyme is mainly found in phagocytes, but also in structural cells from the intestinal mucosa. The aim of this study was to characterize iNOS in intestine and lymphohaematopoietic organs (spleen and anterior kidney) of turbot by means of immunohistochemistry in order to assess the possible changes of this enzyme through the infection. The presence of the enzyme was evaluated in control and E. scophthalmi-infected turbot. The results showed immunoreactivity in the apical border of enterocytes and mild staining of goblet cells in both control and infected turbot although it was more evident and widespread in infected turbot compared to control. Moderate numbers of iNOS+ cells were present in the lamina propria-submucosa of fish which presented moderate and severe inflammatory infiltrates at this level. In spleen and kidney, iNOS+ cells were scattered through the parenchyma and, in severely infected fish, tended to be allocated near the vascular structures and melano-macrophage centres. The number of positive cells at the lymphohaematopoietic organs was significantly higher in infected turbot and increased as infection progressed. The increase in the expression of iNOS in the tissues of E. scophthalmi-infected turbot was more evident in individuals with severer lesions. The measurement of the levels of iNOS during turbot enteromyxosis reveals a possibly delayed response that would not able to eliminate the parasites but would exacerbate mucosal injury.},

abstract = {The impact of antibiotics on the host's protective microbiota and the resulting increased susceptibility to mucosal infection are poorly understood. In this study, antibiotic regimens commonly applied to murine enteritis models are used to examine the impact of antibiotics on the intestinal microbiota, the time course of recovery of the biota, and the resulting susceptibility to enteric Salmonella infection. Molecular analysis of the microbiota showed that antibiotic treatment has an impact on the colonization of the murine gut that is site and antibiotic dependent. While combinations of antibiotics were able to eliminate culturable bacteria, none of the antibiotic treatments were effective at sterilizing the intestinal tract. Recovery of total bacterial numbers occurs within 1 week after antibiotic withdrawal, but alterations in specific bacterial groups persist for several weeks. Increased Salmonella translocation associated with antibiotic pretreatment corrects rapidly in association with the recovery of the most dominant bacterial group, which parallels the recovery of total bacterial numbers. However, susceptibility to intestinal colonization and mucosal inflammation persists when mice are infected several weeks after withdrawal of antibiotics, correlating with subtle alterations in the intestinal microbiome involving alterations of specific bacterial groups. These results show that the colonizing microbiotas are integral to mucosal host protection, that specific features of the microbiome impact different aspects of enteric Salmonella pathogenesis, and that antibiotics can have prolonged deleterious effects on intestinal colonization resistance.},

In teleost, IL-12p40 homologues have been identified in several species, however, the biological function of fish IL-12p40 is essentially unknown. In this work, we reported the identification and analysis of an IL-12p40, OfIL-12p40, from rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus). OfIL-12p40 is composed of 361 amino acids and possesses a conserved IL-12p40 domain and a WSxWS signature motif characteristic of known IL-12p40. Constitutive expression of OfIL-12p40 occurred in multiple tissues and was highest in kidney. Experimental infection with bacterial pathogen upregulated the expression of OfIL-12p40 in kidney and spleen in a time-dependent manner. Purified recombinant OfIL-12p40 (rOfIL-12p40) stimulated the respiratory burst activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in a dose-dependent manner. rOfIL-12p40 also enhanced the resistance of rock bream against bacterial infection and upregulated the expression of innate immune genes in kidney. Taken together, these results indicate that OfIL-12p40 possesses cytokine-like property and plays a role in immune defense against bacterial infection.},

Immunization with a killed R. salmoninarum preparation in Freund's incomplete adjuvant significantly increased nitrate levels after challenge. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) transcript expression was detectable in rainbow trout tissues after injection challenge with R. salmoninarum, and its induction in the gills was both quick (between 3 and 6 hr) and relatively prolonged (lasting several days). iNOS expression in the kidney was also seen at a later stage (24 hr) but appeared to switch off relatively rapidly. Bath challenge with R. salmoninarum also induced iNOS expression in gill, and a variable expression in the gut and kidney also occurred. These results highlight the importance of the gills, not only as a point of entry of pathogens but also as a tissue capable of mounting an immune response.},

Here we report the identification and cloning of a hepcidin cDNA from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.). The cod hepcidin cDNA was predicted to encode a prepropeptide of 98 amino acids (aa) with a signal peptide of 22 aa. A tentative RX(K/R)R motif for propeptide convertases was also identified suggesting a cleavage site located between Arg(72) and Gln(73). The deduced mature cod hepcidin sequence of 26 aa shows similarity to other reported hepcidins and the gene organization is also similar to corresponding genes in mammals and fish consisting of three exons and two introns. As reported for most other species, the expression level of cod hepcidin was highest in liver. However, high levels of hepcidin expression were also observed in the head kidney and peritoneum and an upregulation of hepcidin transcription was seen in all tissues examined 2 days after i.p. injection of formalin-inactivated Listonella (Vibrio) anguillarum. Poly I:C was also able to induce hepcidin transcription. In situ hybridization showed a leukocytic morphology and localization of hepcidin-positive cells in several tissues, and the expression data imply that cod hepcidin is an important component of the first-line defense against invading pathogens.},

abstract = {It is well known that IFN-$\gamma$ is a prime activator of nitric oxide (NO) production by monocytes/macrophages in mammals and fish. In parallel, whether IFN-$\gamma$-activated lymphocytes are associated with NO production remains unclear. In this study, grass carp monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes from head kidney were isolated and effects of recombinant grass carp IFN-$\gamma$ (rgcIFN-$\gamma$) on NO releases by these two cell populations were determined. Results showed that rgcIFN-$\gamma$ time- and dose-dependently increased NO production by monocytes/macrophages but not lymphocytes, which are consistent with the findings in mammals. Interestingly, rgcIFN-$\gamma$ displayed a greater stimulation on NO production in the co-cultures of monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes when compared with that in the culture of monocytes/macrophages alone. Furthermore, the media harvested from rgcIFN-$\gamma$-treated lymphocytes were effective in boosting NO release in monocytes/macrophages. These data suggest that secretions from rgcIFN-$\gamma$-treated lymphocytes may be involved in the NO release by monocytes/macrophages. To address this hypothesis, effect of rgcIFN-$\gamma$ on the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines in grass carp lymphocytes was examined, showing that it consistently stimulated the mRNA expression of grass carp TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$ but not IFN-$\gamma$. Furthermore, treatment of rgcIFN-$\gamma$ combined with recombinant grass carp IL-1$\beta$ (rgcIL-1$\beta$) induced a NO production by monocytes/macrophages, which was significantly higher than those induced by either cytokine alone. It provides the evidence that the cytokines secreted by the activated lymphocytes may facilitate the NO production by monocytes/macrophages. Taken together, our findings point out a new mechanism for the involvement of IFN-$\gamma$-activated lymphocytes in the NO production by monocytes/macrophages in fish. This knowledge not only strengthens the role of IFN-$\gamma$ in immune system but also provides the evidence for the existence of a close relationship between lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages in fish.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: BLAST is a commonly-used software package for comparing a query sequence to a database of known sequences; in this study, we focus on protein sequences. Position-specific-iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) iteratively searches a protein sequence database, using the matches in round i to construct a position-specific score matrix (PSSM) for searching the database in round i + 1. Biegert and Soding developed Context-sensitive BLAST (CS-BLAST), which combines information from searching the sequence database with information derived from a library of short protein profiles to achieve better homology detection than PSI-BLAST, which builds its PSSMs from scratch. RESULTS: We describe a new method, called domain enhanced lookup time accelerated BLAST (DELTA-BLAST), which searches a database of pre-constructed PSSMs before searching a protein-sequence database, to yield better homology detection. For its PSSMs, DELTA-BLAST employs a subset of NCBI's Conserved Domain Database (CDD). On a test set derived from ASTRAL, with one round of searching, DELTA-BLAST achieves a ROC\_5000 of 0.270 vs. 0.116 for CS-BLAST. The performance advantage diminishes in iterated searches, but DELTA-BLAST continues to achieve better ROC scores than CS-BLAST. CONCLUSIONS: DELTA-BLAST is a useful program for the detection of remote protein homologs. It is available under the "Protein BLAST" link at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.

abstract = {Redox regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression was investigated in lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma (LPS + IFNgamma)-stimulated microvascular endothelial cells from mouse skeletal muscle. Unstimulated endothelial cells produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive to inhibition of NADPH oxidase (apocynin and DPI), mitochondrial respiration (rotenone) and NOS (L-NAME). LPS + IFNgamma caused a marked increase in ROS production; this increase was abolished by inhibition of NADPH oxidase (apocynin, DPI and p47phox deficiency). LPS + IFNgamma induced substantial expression of iNOS protein. iNOS expression was prevented by the antioxidant ascorbate and by NADPH oxidase inhibition (apocynin, DPI and p47phox deficiency), but not by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (rotenone) and xanthine oxidase (allopurinol). iNOS expression also was prevented by selective antagonists of ERK, JNK, Jak2, and NFkappaB activation. LPS + IFNgamma stimulated activation/phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and Jak2 and activation/degradation of IkappaB, but only the activation of JNK and Jak2 was sensitive to ascorbate, apocynin and p47phox deficiency. Ascorbate, apocynin and p47phox deficiency also inhibited the LPS + IFNgamma-induced DNA binding activity of transcription factors IRF1 and AP1 but not NFkappaB. In conclusion, LPS + IFNgamma-induced NFkappaB activation is necessary for iNOS induction but is not dependent on ROS signaling. LPS + IFNgamma-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity produces ROS that activate the JNK-AP1 and Jak2-IRF1 signaling pathways required for iNOS induction. Since blocking either NFkappaB activation or NADPH oxidase activity is sufficient to prevent iNOS expression, they are separate targets for therapeutic interventions that aim to modulate iNOS expression in sepsis.},

abstract = {Functional feeds are diets that have positive effects on both health and growth promoting performance of the animals ingesting them, by supplying additional compounds above and beyond the basic nutritional requirements for animal growth alone. The most common additives used in aquaculture diets are probiotics, prebiotics, immunostimulants, vitamins and nucleotides. Inclusion of these components to fish diets can increase feed conversion efficiency and growth, as well as having positive effects on the fish immune system. This review discusses the results from previous studies on fish nutrition and includes a novel genomic approach, using microarray analysis, to elucidate nutritional responses in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fed a newly developed functional feed health premix diet. The transcriptome analysis demonstrated that compared to the standard diet feeding with the functional feed had significant effects on biological processes in the liver. This resulted in a reduction of the expression of genes related to protein turnover, reduced circulating plasma proteins and a down regulation of genes involved in the immune response. These results suggest that the functional feed may infer a decrease in whole body metabolic demands, suppressing both protein turnover and whole body oxygen demand, as well as down regulating several genes involved in the innate immune system. Together these changes appear to result in less energy wastage in fish and an enhanced growth and performance.},

In this study, the role of the intestine as a colonization site for F. psychrophilum was determined. For this purpose, the ability of a high (Dubois) and a low (99/10A) virulence strain of F. psychrophilum to adhere to intestinal explants of rainbow trout was evaluated. After incubation, samples of the gut were examined bacteriologically, histologically and by electron microscopy. The number of gut-associated F. psychrophilum bacteria was significantly higher for the Dubois than for the 99/10A strain. Histological samples clearly showed numerous bacteria of the high virulence strain associated with the intestinal tissue as opposed to only a few bacteria of the low virulence strain. Additionally, extensive exfoliation of intestinal epithelium was noted after incubation with the high virulence strain, but less with the low virulence strain. These findings were confirmed using scanning electron microscopy and suggest that the intestinal epithelium might represent an important site for colonization of the F. psychrophilum strain and may act as a portal of entry for high virulence F. psychrophilum.},

In the present work we have evaluated the dietary effect of $\beta$-1,3/1,6-glucan (isolated from Laminarina digitata) and Pdp 11 (Shewanella putrefaciens, probiotic isolated from gilthead seabream skin), single or combined, on growth, humoural (seric level of total IgM antibodies and peroxidase and antiprotease activities) and cellular innate immune response (peroxidase and phagocytic activities of head-kidney leucocytes), as well as the expression of immune-related genes in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). Four treatment groups were established: control (non-supplemented diet), Pdp 11 (10(9) cfu g(-1)), $\beta$-1,3/1,6-glucan (0.1\%) and $\beta$-1,3/1,6-glucan + Pdp 11 (0.1\% and 10(9) cfu g(-1), respectively). Fish were sampled after 1, 2 and 4 weeks of feeding. Interestingly, all supplemented diets produced increments in the seabream growth rates, mainly the Pdp 11-suplemented diet. Overall, Pdp 11 dietary administration resulted in decreased serum IgM levels and peroxidase activity. However, the seric antiprotease activity was increased in fish fed with both supplements together. Furthermore, $\beta$-1,3/1,6-glucan and combined diet increased phagocytic activity after 2 or 4 weeks. At gene level, IL-1$\beta$ and INF$\gamma$ transcripts were always up-regulated in HK but only the interleukin reached significance after 4 weeks in the group fed with $\beta$-glucan. On the contrary, IgM gene expression tended to be down-regulated being significant after 1 week in seabream specimens fed with $\beta$-glucan or $\beta$-glucan plus Pdp 11. These results suggest that $\beta$-1,3/1,6-glucan and Pdp 11 modulate the immune response and stimulates growth of the gilthead seabream, one of the species with the highest rate of production in Mediterranean aquaculture.},

abstract = {In the current work, we have demonstrated that both rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) interleukin 8 (IL-8), a CXC chemokine, and CK-6, a CC chemokine, are able of efficiently attracting RTS11, a rainbow trout established macrophage-monocyte-like cell line. Interestingly, two sub-populations of non-adherent cells are distinguishable by flow cytometry that could be identified as immature monocyte- and mature macrophage-like populations, respectively, and the two chemokines studied exert their effects on different populations. Although IL-8 specifically attracts the monocyte-like sub-population, CK-6 specifically attracts the macrophage-like cell sub-population. We have also determined the effects of both of these chemokines on RTS11 phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the expression of other immune-related genes. We found that IL-8 inhibited the phagocytosis capacity of RTS11 cells belonging to the macrophage-like profile. No effect was observed, however, on the respiratory burst, immune function that has been considerably affected throughout the establishment of the cell culture. Concerning the effect that IL-8 and CK-6 have on the expression of other immune genes, we found that IL-8 significantly induced the levels of expression of CK-6, IL-8, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) of RTS11 cells. On the other hand, CK-6 induced the levels of expression of IL-8, iNOS and the integrin CD-18, while it had very faint effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results constitute one of the very few studies in which the effect of IL-8, a CXC chemokine, on monocyte-like cells is described. Moreover, it demonstrates that different monocyte-macrophage sub-populations have different reactivity to different chemokines.},

abstract = {Interferons (IFNs) are secreted proteins, which induce vertebrate cells into an antiviral state. In mammals, three families of IFNs (type I IFN, type II IFN and IFN-lambda) can be distinguished on the basis of gene structure, protein structure and functional properties. Type I IFNs, which include IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, are encoded by intron lacking genes and have a major role in the first line of defense against viruses. The human IFN-lambdas have similar biological properties as type I IFNs, but are encoded by intron containing genes. Type II IFN is identical to IFN-gamma, which is produced by T helper 1 cells in response to mitogens and antigens and has a key role in adaptive cell mediated immunity. IFNs, which show structural and functional properties similar to mammalian type I IFNs, have recently been cloned from Atlantic salmon, channel catfish, pufferfish, and zebrafish. Teleost fish appear to have at least two type I IFN genes. Phylogenetic sequence analysis shows that the fish type I IFNs form a group separated from the avian type I IFNs and the mammalian IFN-alpha, -beta and -lambda groups. Interestingly, the fish IFNs possess the same exon/intron structure as the IFN-lambdas, but show most sequence similarity to IFN-alpha. Recently, IFN-gamma genes have also been cloned from several fish species and shown to have the same exon/intron structure as mammalian IFN-gamma genes. The antiviral effect of mammalian type I IFN is exerted through binding to the IFN-alpha/beta-receptor, which triggers signal transduction through the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway resulting in expression of Mx and other antiviral proteins. Putative IFN receptor genes have been identified in pufferfish. Several interferon regulatory factors and members of the JAK-STAT pathway have also been identified in various fish species. Moreover, Mx and several other interferon stimulated genes have been cloned and studied in fish. Furthermore, antiviral activity of Mx protein from Atlantic salmon and Japanese flounder has recently been demonstrated.},

abstract = {The immune response can be modulated by nutrients like beta-glucans, which are glucose polymers that are major structural components of the cell wall of yeast, fungi, and bacteria, but also of cereals like oat and barley. There is a lot of structural variation in the beta-glucans from these different sources, which may influence their physiological functions. In this review the current status concerning possibilities to modulate immune function by beta-glucans is discussed. In vitro as well as in vivo studies in animals and humans show that especially beta-glucans derived from fungi and yeast have immune modulating properties. Most frequently evaluated are effects on leukocyte activity, which has been suggested to contribute to the increased resistance against infections observed after beta-glucan interventions. Although most studies supply the beta-glucans parenteral (e.g. intravenous or subcutaneous), also enteral administrated (dietary) beta-glucan influence the immune response. Although more human studies are needed, it is tempting to suggest that dietary beta-glucans may be a useful tool to prime the host immune system and increase resistance against invading pathogens.},

Although originally defined as an agent with direct antiviral activity, the properties of IFN-gamma include regulation of several aspects of the immune response, stimulation of bactericidal activity of phagocytes, stimulation of antigen presentation through class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, orchestration of leukocyte-endothelium interactions, effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as the stimulation and repression of a variety of genes whose functional significance remains obscure. The implementation of such a variety of effects by a single cytokine is achieved by complex patterns of cell-specific gene regulation: Several IFN-gamma-regulated genes are themselves components of transcription factors. The IFN-gamma response is itself regulated by interaction with responses to other cytokines including IFN-alpha/beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-4. Over 200 genes are now known to be regulated by IFN-gamma and they are listed in a World Wide Web document that accompanies this review. However, much of the cellular response to IFN-gamma can be described in terms of a set of integrated molecular programs underlying well-defined physiological systems, for example the induction of efficient antigen processing for MHC-mediated antigen presentation, which play clearly defined roles in pathogen resistance. A promising approach to the complexity of the IFN-gamma response is to extend the analysis of the less understood IFN-gamma-regulated genes in terms of molecular programs functional in pathogen resistance.},

Phylogenetic analyses show that one of the three CXC chemokines is an unambiguous orthologue of CXCL14, whereas both others are orthologues of CXCL12, and were named CXCL12a and CXCL12b. Percentages of amino acid identity between each of these carp chemokines and their human and mouse orthologues are markedly higher than those reported previously for other carp CXC chemokines, suggestive of involvement in vital processes, which have allowed for relatively few structural changes. Furthermore, all three novel carp CXC chemokines are expressed during early development, in contrast to established immune CXC chemokines. In noninfected adult carp, CXCL12b and CXCL14 are predominantly expressed in the brain. CXCL12a is highly expressed in kidney and anterior kidney, but its expression is still more abundant in brain than any other carp CXC chemokine. Clearly, these chemokines must play key roles in the patterning and maintenance of the (developing) vertebrate central nervous system.},

abstract = {A full-length inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene has been sequenced for the first time outside the mammals, and the gene organization compared with that already determined for human iNOS. While there are some differences from the human gene, overall the exons show remarkable conservation in sequence and organization. As in human, the trout iNOS gene has 27 exons, with 18 of the trout exons being identical in size with the equivalent human exons. The cofactor-binding domains are found in the same exons and in some cases are absolutely conserved. Differences include the start of the ORF in exon 3 instead of exon 2, resulting in a deletion at the 5' end of the trout iNOS protein. Exon 27 also shows a large difference in size and although the trout exon is larger this is due to the length of the 3'-UTR. Several non-mammalian features are notable, and include a conserved potential glycosylation site in chicken and fish, and an insertion at the boundary of exons 20 and 21 in fish. The intron sizes in trout were generally much smaller than in human iNOS, making the trout iNOS gene approximately half the size of the human gene. Analysis of RNA secondary structure revealed two regions with complementarity, which could interfere with reverse transcription. Using a trout fibroblast cell line (RTG-2 cells), it was shown by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR that virus infection was a good inducer of iNOS expression. However, when using a combination of Superscripttrade mark II for reverse transcription and primers at the 5' end of the gene only very weak products were amplified, in contrast with the situation when primers at the 3' end of the gene were used, or ThermoScripttrade mark-derived cDNA was used. The impact of such results on RT-PCR analysis of iNOS expression in trout is discussed.},

In the present study, we examined the effects of PFOS on motor neurons, and investigated the potential toxicological mechanisms oxidative stress in zebrafish embryos. Six-hour post-fertilization (hpf) zebrafish embryos were exposed to 1.0 mg/L PFOS, then we examined the expression of alpha-tubulin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), and peroxiredoxin 2 (PRX2) after PFOS exposure until 120 hpf. The results showed that PFOS increased alpha-tubulin in the coccygeal spinal cord (CSC) at 96 hpf, whereas decreased alpha-tubulin in the brain and spinal cord at 120 hpf. PCNA expression was highly increased in CSC and abdomen compared with control at 96 and 120 hpf after PFOS exposure. In addition, PFOS exposure caused CDK5 expression to be highly increased in brain region following by down-regulation of PRX2 expression at 96 hpf. These results indicated that, at least in part, the effect on motor neurons induced by PFOS was mediated by dynamically interfering with the expression of alpha-tubulin and PCNA. Furthermore, PFOS-induced toxicity was associated with oxidative stress by deregulating CDK5 and PRX2.},

Little is known about cathelicidins in fish and here the Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) embryo cell line (CHSE-214) was used as a model system to study the expression of cathelicidins due to fish pathogenic bacteria. The cDNA of cathelicidin from CHSE-214 cells (csCath) was cloned and shown to be closely related to gene 2 of both rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon. The deducted amino acid sequence showed highest sequence identity to rtCath2 with 95\% and 72\% for the cathelin and the antibacterial part, respectively. Cathelicidin gene expression was studied and various Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria caused the upregulation of the gene (csCath). Bacterial DNA and protein were shown important for the induction of cathelicidin expression in these cells. LPS (Escherichia coli) also causes the upregulation of cathelicidins, but digestion of the LPS with DNase I before incubation of the cells, totally abolished the upregulation of cathelicidin and suggests DNA contamination in the LPS to be the trigger for this effect. These results could explain the limited responsiveness of fish cells towards pure LPS and confirm previous suggestions that fish cells are less sensitive to LPS than mammalian cells.},

abstract = {In vertebrates, the diverse and extended range of antigenic motifs is matched to large populations of lymphocytes. The concept of immune repertoire was proposed to describe this diversity of lymphocyte receptors--IG and TR--required for the recognition specificity. Immune repertoires have become useful tools to describe lymphocyte and receptor populations during the immune system development and in pathological situations. In teleosts, the presence of conventional T cells was first proposed to explain graft rejection and optimized specific antibody production. The discovery of TR genes definitely established the reality of conventional T cells in fish. The development of genomic and EST databases recently led to the description of several key T cell markers including CD4, CD8, CD3, CD28, CTLA4, as well as important cytokines, suggesting the existence of different T helper (Th) subtypes, similar to the mammalian Th1, Th2 and Th17. Over the last decade, repertoire studies have demonstrated that both public and private responses occur in fish as they do in mammals, and in vitro specific cytotoxicity assays have been established. While such typical features of T cells are similar in both fish and mammals, the structure of particular repertoires such as the one of gut intra-epithelial lymphocytes seems to be very different. Future studies will further reveal the particular characteristics of teleost T cell repertoires and adaptive responses.},

abstract = {Macrophages produce a large volume of ROS (reactive oxygen species) through respiratory burst. However, the influence of iNOS [inducible NOS (nitric oxide synthase)] activation on ROS production remains unclear. In the present study, the kinetic generation of ROS in RAW264.7 murine macrophages was monitored by chemiluminescence. PMA induces a robust chemiluminescence in RAW264.7 cells, suggesting PKC (protein kinase C)-related assembly and activation of NOX (NADPH oxidase). The effects of iNOS induction on ROS production were examined. Induction of iNOS expression in RAW264.7 cells with LPS (lipopolysaccharide; 1 microg/ml) causes a significant increase in PMA-induced chemiluminescence, which could be enhanced by the NOS substrate, L-arginine, and could be abolished by the NOS inhibitor, L-NNA (NG-nitro-L-arginine). Further experiments reveal that induction of iNOS expression enhances the PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of the p47phox subunit of NOX, and promotes the relocalization of cytosolic p47phox and p67phox subunits to the membrane. Inhibition of PKCzeta by its myristoylated pseudosubstrate significantly decreased the PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of the p47phox in LPS-pretreated cells, suggesting that PKCzeta is involved in the iNOS-dependent assembly and activation of NOX. Taken together, the present study suggests that the induction of iNOS upregulates the PMA-induced assembly of NOX and leads to the enhanced production of ROS via a PKCzeta-dependent mechanism.},

abstract = {Identification and characterization of subpopulations of cells involved in immunological reactions against invading organisms is essential for understanding defense mechanisms against disease. In lower vertebrates like teleost fish, as opposed to mammals, immune cell subsets are still poorly defined, mostly due to the lack of appropriate working tools like antibodies and functional assays. Membrane bound molecules like immunoglobulins (Ig) serve as cell surface markers for specific cell subsets and the identification of cells relies upon the production of specific antibodies towards these molecules. The present study aimed at identifying tools to separate IgM positive (IgM(+)) B cells from IgM negative (IgM(-)) non-B cell populations using flow cytometry. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and one polyclonal antibody (pAb) to both rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo Salar) IgM, either commercially available or locally produced were tested for their recognition of Atlantic salmon IgM+ cells. Leukocytes were isolated from peripheral blood (PB), spleen (S) and head kidney (HK) and stained with all mAbs and the pAb, to possibly verify the approximate number of IgM+ cells in the respective tissues in salmon. To our surprise, this seemingly simple task did not reveal similar staining patterns for all antibodies as expected, but rather large differences in the number of positively stained cells were discovered. In short, positively stained cells by each antibody ranged from below 5\% to above 80\% with similar ratios between the antibodies in each tissue. The three most used mAbs, 4c10, N2 and 1.14; originally produced towards rainbow trout IgM, recognize only a fraction of salmon B cells as previously shown for the 4c10 mAb binding exclusively to the IgM-A isotype. In comparison, our three novel mAbs, IgF1-3, -18 and -19, bind to both IgM-A and -B isotypes as shown using intracellular staining of 293T cells transfected with both IgM- A and -B constructs. Based on binding percentages, one of three commercially available Abs, IgH FITC from Cedarlane, may also identify both isotypes. The three new IgF1-3, -18 and -19 mAbs and potentially IgH FITC from Cedarlane, provides us with great tools enabling complete depletion or enrichment of IgM(+) B cells and/or IgM(-) T cells in Atlantic salmon.},

abstract = {As key effector molecules of jawed vertebrate's adaptive immune system, immunoglobulins are produced by B lymphocytes, either as a secretory form (antibody) or as a membrane form (B cell receptor). Until recently, teleost fish B cells were thought to express only two classes of immunoglobulins, IgM and IgD. In addition, IgM in these species was thought to be the only immunoglobulin isotype responding to pathogens both in systemic or mucosal compartments. However, the unexpected discovery of IgT, a new teleost immunoglobulin unearthed in 2005, has provided for new opportunities to analyze further roles of teleost immunoglobulins in these two physiologically distinct compartments. The smoke about the potential function of IgT has cleared recently with the finding that this immunoglobulin appears to be specialized in gut mucosal immunity. Significantly, the new capability of measuring not only IgM but also IgT responses will greatly facilitate the evaluation and understanding of fish immune responses as well as the protective effects of fish vaccines. The purpose of this review is to summarize the molecular characterization of new IgT orthologs and subtypes in teleosts, as well as to describe the new findings concerning the protein structure of IgT, the B cells producing it, and its role in mucosal immunity.},

The percentage of cells that could adhere to a smooth plastic surface increased with increasing incubation time. Endocytosis was effective for heterologous (human immunoglobulin G, IgGh; ovine somatotropin, oST) but not homologous proteins (recombinant trout somatotropin, rtST). The activity of cathepsin D increased significantly after the endocytosis of a heterologous protein. Finally, the analysis of immunoblots of homogenates of granulocytes incubated in the presence of the two different proteins was used to show the endocytosis and degradation of heterologous proteins. These results show that isolated EGCs can endocytose and degrade heterologous proteins.},

In addition, the internal organs (kidney, liver, and spleen) of healthy fish may contain bacteria, but there is debate on whether or not muscle is actually sterile. The numbers and taxonomic composition of the bacterial populations often reflect those of the surrounding water. The role of the bacteria includes the ability to degrade complex molecules (therefore exercising a potential benefit in nutrition), to produce vitamins and polymers, and to be responsible for the emission of light by the light-emitting organs of deep-sea fish. Taxa, including Pseudomonas, may contribute to spoilage by the production of histamines in fish tissue.},

abstract = {The mucosal immune systems of fishes are still poorly understood, and defined models for studying natural host-pathogen interactions are lacking. The objective of this study was to evaluate different challenge models and pathogens to examine the magnitude of change in intestinal immune gene expression. Rainbow trout were exposed by immersion to Yersinia ruckeri or by intraperitoneal injection with Flavobacterium psychrophilum. At 3, 9, or 10 days post-challenge, pathogen load was quantified by plate count and intestinal tissue was removed and immune gene expression measured by real-time PCR. In general, the magnitude of infection was correlated with change in immune gene transcript abundance. We found that messages for the innate immune molecules, SAA, IL-8, INF-$\gamma$ and TNF-$\alpha$, as well as the message for IgM, were up-regulated in intestinal tissue in both challenge paradigms. A >250-fold increase was observed in SAA and 20-fold increase of IL-8 gene transcript abundance occurred on day 10 following challenge with F. psychrophilum. Within individual fish, there was a positive correlation between bacteria load in the spleen and the increase of immune gene message between 3 and 10 days post-infection. These findings demonstrate that measurable changes in immune gene expression occur in the intestine of rainbow trout following bath challenge with Y. ruckeri or injection challenge with F. psychrophilum.},

abstract = {Understanding pathogen recognition and mechanisms in Atlantic cod are of significant importance for both basic research on wild populations and health management in aquaculture. A microarray approach was utilized to search for effects of viral (polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid), bacterial (lipopolysaccharide) and polyclonal activator (phytohaemoagglutinin) stress in Atlantic cod head kidney cells. LPS cell activation increased mRNA expression of interleukin 8; interleukin-1$\beta$; cyclooxygenase 2; leukocyte derived chemotaxin 2; carboxyl-esterase 2 and environmental biomarker cytochrome P450 1A. Mitogen activated protein kinase p38 and cathepsin F were down regulated by LPS. The antiviral responses induced by double stranded RNA clearly increased transcription of Toll like receptor 3 and interferon stimulating gene 15. The phytohaemoagglutinin response seemed to be more non-specific. Special for the phytohaemoagglutinin induction was the increase in major histocompatibility complex class I. CC chemokine type 2 mRNA expression was increased by phytohaemoagglutinin, lipopolysaccharide and polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid, while mitogen activated protein kinase p38 and leukocyte derived chemotaxin 2 were down regulated by phytohaemoagglutinin. Oxidative stress related genes like catalase and glutaredoxin and the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 showed no transcriptional changes compared to control in any of the treatments. Eicosanoids like prostaglandin 2, leukotriene B4 and B5 were constitutively produced by cod head kidney cells in vitro. The most remarkable feature of eicosanoid secretion is the higher production of leukotrienes against prostaglandins, indicating that the lipooxygenase pathway is preferred over the cyclooxygenase pathway. Although there were no significant differences in eicosanoid secretion between the groups, polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid showed a clear tendency to increase the levels of leukotriene B4 and B5. This study reveals distinct signatures of bacteria and virus transcriptional responses in cod head kidney cells. In addition, the novel finding that cytochrome P450 1A was upregulated during the antibacterial response indicates a connection between immunity and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in Atlantic cod.},

abstract = {Macrophages are phagocytes that have a central role in the organization of the immune system after an infection. These cells can recognize specific molecular components of micro-organisms (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs) via specific receptors (PRRs) and elicit specific cellular responses. In the past, the expression of immune genes in response to different PAMPs has been characterized in different fish species. However, little is known about actual cytokine release. We characterized the secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$ in primary macrophage cultures of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in response to several PAMPs by Western blot and compared this to the induction of TNF-$\alpha$ gene expression as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$ and IL-6 and anti-viral molecules such as INF-$\alpha$ and Mx protein (Mx). We show that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and zymosan are major inducers of TNF-$\alpha$ secretion, which is not initially linked to the induction of TNF-$\alpha$ mRNA expression. The secretion of TNF-$\alpha$, but intriguingly not the expression, is also stimulated by ultrapure LPS meaning that, in fish, contaminants of commercial LPS preparations are better inducers of the inflammatory response. Moreover, we have characterized the signaling pathways that are activated by different PAMPs and the link between those pathways and the final step of TNF-$\alpha$ secretion: TNF-$\alpha$ shedding by TNF-$\alpha$ converting enzyme (TACE/ ADAM17). For the first time, we show that, in fish macrophages, TNF-$\alpha$ is processed by TACE-like activity and this cleavage is dependent upon the activation of ERK, p38MAPK and JNK signaling pathways by LPS.},

Recombinant goldfish TNFalpha-2 (rg TNFalpha-2), rgIFNgamma but not rgTGFbeta induced time-dependent increase of CSF-1 expression in macrophages. Treatment of goldfish macrophages with rgCSF-1 increased expression of several immune genes including CXCL-8 (=IL-8), CCL-1, TNFalpha-1, TNFalpha-2, IL-1beta-1, IL-1beta-2, IL-12-p35, IL-12-p40, IFN, IL-10 and iNOS A and B. The rgCSF-1 treatment did not significantly alter the mRNA levels of TGFbeta and NRAMP in macrophages up to 48h post treatment. However, at 72h post treatment, the expression of TGFbeta increased whereas that of NRAMP decreased. The treatment of macrophages with rgCSF-1 enhanced their respiratory burst and nitric oxide responses that were abrogated after addition of soluble CSF-1 receptor (sCSF-1R) to cell cultures. Macrophages exhibited a concentration-dependent chemotactic response toward rgCSF-1 as well as an increase in phagocytic activity that was abrogated after addition of sCSF-1R to cell cultures. Our results indicate that in addition to being an important growth factor of goldfish macrophages, rgCSF-1 also plays a central role in the regulation of their pro-inflammatory responses.},

abstract = {Chemokines and chemokine receptors are key evolutionary innovations of vertebrates. They are involved in morphogenetic processes and play an important role in the immune system. Based on an analysis of the chemokine receptor gene family in teleost genomes, and the expression patterns of chemokine receptor genes during embryogenesis and the wounding response in young larvae of Oryzias latipes, we identified the chemokine receptor cxcr3a as a marker of innate immune cells. Cells expressing cxcr3a were characterized in fish transgenic for a cxcr3a:gfp reporter. In embryos and larvae, cxcr3a-expressing cells are motile in healthy and damaged tissues, and phagocytic; the majority of these cells has the morphology of tissue macrophages, whereas a small fraction has a dendritic phenotype. In adults, cxcr3a-positive cells continue to specifically express myeloid-associate markers and genes related to antigen uptake and presentation. By light microscopy and ultrastructural analysis, the majority of cxcr3a-expressing cells has a dendritic phenotype, whereas the remainder resembles macrophage-like cells. After challenge of adult fish with bacteria or CpG oligonucleotides, phagocytosing cxcr3a-positive cells in the blood up-regulated il12p40 genes, compatible with their function as part of the mononuclear phagocytic system. Our results identify a marker of teleost mononuclear phagocytic cells and suggest a surprising degree of morphological and functional similarity between the innate immune systems of lower and higher vertebrates.},

abstract = {Ling and hake are tertiary consumers, and as a result both may have an important structuring role in marine communities. The diets of 2064 ling and 913 hake from Chatham Rise, New Zealand, were determined from examination of stomach contents. Ling was a benthic generalist, and hake a demersal piscivore. The diet of ling was characterised by benthic crustaceans, mainly Munida gracilis and Metanephrops challengeri, and demersal fishes, mainly Macrourids and scavenged offal from fishing vessels. The diet of hake was characterised by teleost fishes, mainly macrourids and merlucciids. Multivariate analyses using distance-based linear models found the most important predictors of diet variability were depth, fish length, and vessel type (whether the sample was collected from a commercial or research vessel) for ling, and fish length and vessel type for hake. There was no interspecific predation between ling and hake, and resource competition was largely restricted to macrourid prey, although the dominant macrourid species predated by ling and hake were different. Cluster analysis of average diet of intraspecific groups of ling and hake confirmed the persistent diet separation. Although size is a central factor in determining ecological processes, similar sized ling and hake had distinctly different foraging ecology, and therefore could influence the ecosystem in different ways, and be unequally affected by ecosystem fluctuations.},

In the present study, the native IL-1beta precursor or mature peptides were detected at sizes of approx. 29 kDa and 24 kDa in cell lysates of a rainbow trout macrophage cell line RTS-11, with or without LPS stimulation, by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against the putative trout mature IL-1beta (rmIL-1beta) produced in Escherichia coli. Processing of the 29 kDa precursor into a 24 kDa mature peptide was confirmed by analysis of such proteins using a monoclonal conjugate (Ni-NTA-HRP) against 6 histidines in lysates of the RTS-11 cells transfected with an expression plasmid containing the IL-1beta precursor molecule tagged with 6 histidines at its C terminus. Only the recombinant mature 24 kDa) IL-1beta/HIS protein was purified from the culture supernatants of the transfected cells, indicating the molecule is cleaved to be secreted.

abstract = {Cathelicidins are a family of antimicrobial peptides that act as effector molecules of the innate immune system with broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. These evolutionary conserved cationic host-defence peptides are integral components of the immune response of fish, which are generally believed to rely heavily on innate immune defences to invading pathogens. In this study we showed that Atlantic salmon cathelicidin 1 and 2 (asCATH1 and asCATH2) stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes increasing the transcription of the chemokine interleukin-8. Further, functional differences were identified between the two cathelicidins. In the presence of serum, asCATH1 displayed greatly diminished host haemolytic activity, while the constitutively expressed asCATH2 had no haemolytic activity with or without serum. These findings support our hypothesis that fish cathelicidins exert their primary antimicrobial action at the site of pathogen invasion such as epithelial surfaces. Further, we hypothesise that like their mammalian counterparts in the presence of serum they act as mediators of the innate and adaptive immune response via the release of cytokines thus indirectly protecting against a variety of pathogens. We highlight the importance of this immunomodulatory role from the involvement of asCATHs during an infection with the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri. While we were able to demonstrate in vitro that asCATH1 and 2, possessed direct microbicidal activity against the fish pathogen, Vibrio anguillarum, and a common gram negative bacterium, Escherichia coli, little or no bactericidal activity was found against Y. ruckeri. The contribution of either asCATH in the immune response or as a potential virulence factor during yersiniosis is highlighted from the increased expression of asCATH1 and 2 mRNA during an in vivo challenge with Y. ruckeri . We propose that Atlantic salmon cathelicidins participate in the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune systems via the release of cytokines enabling a more effective response to invading pathogens.},

abstract = {Chemokines are small proteins that control cellular migration. An extensive family of these molecules has been described in mammals containing nearly 50 members. Within this family are four groups, each defined by the different spacing of two N-terminal cysteines, which form disulphide bonds with two other cysteine residues to create the tertiary structure characteristic of chemokines. Recent evidence shows the chemokine family is not unique to mammals, with several members also identified in birds, amphibians and fish, including a primitive vertebrate, the lamprey. Although there is less evidence to define the roles of chemokines in these lower vertebrates, structural similarities allow some predictions to their function, against which further studies are being made. Additionally, some microorganisms (particularly viruses) appear to have copied genes for chemokines, presumably to confuse the immune system of their host. This review aims to bring together the current information concerning identified chemokines throughout vertebrates and microorganisms.},

abstract = {In this study, we used a 16S rDNA-based approach to determine bacterial populations associated with coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in its early life stages, highlighting dominant bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract during growth in freshwater. The present article is the first molecular analysis of bacterial communities of coho salmon. Cultivability of the salmon gastrointestinal microbiota was estimated by comparison of direct microscopic counts (using acridine orange) with colony counts (in tryptone soy agar). In general, a low fraction (about 1\%) of the microbiota could be recovered as cultivable bacteria. Using DNA extracted directly from individuals belonging to the same lot, bacterial communities present in eggs and gastrointestinal tract of first-feeding fries and juveniles were monitored by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The DGGE profiles revealed simple communities in all stages and exposed changes in bacterial community during growth. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of excised DGGE bands revealed the nature of the main bacteria found in each stage. In eggs, the dominant bacteria belonged to beta-Proteobacteria (Janthinobacterium and Rhodoferax). During the first feeding stage, the most abundant bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract clustered with gamma-Proteobacteria (Shewanella and Aeromonas). In juveniles ranging from 2 to 15 g, prevailing bacteria were Pseudomonas and Aeromonas. To determine the putative origin of dominant Pseudomonas and Aeromonas found in juvenile gastrointestinal tracts, primers for these groups were designed based on sequences retrieved from DGGE gel. Subsequently, samples of the water influent, pelletized feed, and eggs were analyzed by PCR amplification. Only those amplicons obtained from samples of eggs and the water influent presented identical sequences to the dominant bands of DGGE. Overall, our results suggest that a stable microbiota is established after the first feeding stages and its major components could be derived from water and egg epibiota.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial polypeptides (AMPPs), consisting of peptides and small proteins with antimicrobial activity, are an integral component of innate immunity. Their often potent properties and widespread prevalence in fish suggests that designing means of manipulating their levels has considerable potential for maintaining or improving fish health. There is evidence that a number of chronic stresses lead to significant downregulation of AMPPs and thus their monitoring could be a highly sensitive measure of health status and risk of an infectious disease outbreak. Conversely, upregulation of AMPP expression could be used to enhance disease resistance in stressful environments, as well as improve the efficacy of traditional antimicrobial drugs. However, further work is required in linking levels of a number of AMPPs to physiological function since, while a number of studies have documented the down- or upregulation of AMPPs via gene expression, relatively few studies have quantitatively examined changes in protein expression. In addition, not all AMPPs appear to be expressed at microbicidal levels in vivo, suggesting that at least some may have functions other than being directly protective. Nonetheless, in fish, there is evidence that some constitutively expressed AMPPs, such as piscidins and histone-like proteins, are expressed at microbicidal levels and that they decline with stress. Furthermore, certain AMPPs derived from hemoglobin-$\beta$ are upregulated to microbicidal levels after experimental challenge. The likely widespread distribution of these three AMPP groups in fish provides the opportunity to design strategies to greatly improve the health of cultured fish populations.},

abstract = {Cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides, well studied in mammals and found to be multifunctional proteins, important in the fight against bacterial invasion. Cathelicidins in fish have only recently been identified and little is known about their function and importance in the immune system of fish. In this study we have identified several novel cathelicidin proteins in far related fish species such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). Atlantic cod was found to have at least three cathelicidin genes of which two are nearly identical except for a nine-amino acid duplication in the antimicrobial peptide region. The predicted mature peptides of cod were found to be unusual peptides, made mainly of arginine, glycine and serine (RGS) residues and form a novel class of antimicrobial peptides. Cathelicidin in Arctic charr and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were found to have an exon deletion in the cathelin region of the protein, which would lead to the deletion of the predicted loop 2 of cathelin and its adjacent beta-strands. This is the first report of a deletion of a whole exon in the family of the cathelicidins. Infection of fish with pathogenic bacteria caused an upregulation of the expression of the cathelicidins in Arctic charr and Atlantic cod and indicates a role of these proteins in fish innate immunity.},

abstract = {Bacterium Flavobacterium columnare is the causative agent of columnaris disease in many wild and farmed fish species. Immunostimulants are used with success in aquaculture against many pathogens, but the ability to improve innate resistance to columnaris disease has not been studied. Fingerling rainbow trout were treated with two immunostimulants, yeast beta-glucan and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB). Selected innate immune function parameters, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by whole blood and by isolated head kidney leukocytes, plasma lysozyme activity and complement bacteriolytic activity, were determined to assess the immune status of fish. The fish were then bath challenged with virulent F. columnare bacteria, and the mortality of fish was recorded. Given orally both stimulants raised the levels of immune function parameters, but did not improve survival in challenge at any concentration of the stimulants used. Intra peritoneal injection of beta-glucan increased parameter values several fold, but no beneficial effect of injected glucan on survival was noted. As a control, antibiotic medication administered prior to and during the challenge infection prevented the mortality. Innate immune mechanisms, even when induced to high levels with immunostimulants, as evidenced here, were not able to increase resistance against F. columnare. This may be connected to the external character of the infection. The results from the treatments with beta-glucan and HMB suggest that there is little prospect of preventing columnaris disease by means of immunostimulants in early life stage of rainbow trout. However, the efficacy of other immune stimulants remains open.},

The results that F1 contained a high yield in relation to other fractionated fucans. Chemical and structure analysis of F1 was performed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies. The in vitro antioxidant activities of the fraction F1 were also observed. Thus, 2 mg/mL of F1 inhibited the phosphomolybdate in the total antioxidant activity assay. The EC(50) values were 0.3 mg/mL and 0.12 mg/mL for superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, respectively. Fucan F1 (25, 50, and 75 mg/kg by body weight), diclofenac sodium (10 mg/kg), and L-NAME (25 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in rats, according to body weight of different groups of animals (n=6). After 6 h, analyses of cell influx and nitrite levels were conducted. Then after 96 h, analysis of edema and concentration of serum TNF-$\alpha$ was carried out along with histopathological analysis. F1 at 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg i.p. by body weight reduced cell influx in 52.1-96.7\% and nitric oxide level in 27.2-39\% compared with the control group. The reduction of edema and serum TNF-$\alpha$ was observed at 50 mg/kg i.p. (p<0.001). These results suggest that this heterofucan from the brown algae L. variegata has potential anti-inflammatory activity in acute zymosan-induced arthritis in rats and that antioxidant activity promotes modulation in the cellular redox state.},

The peptides are broad spectrum microbicides in vitro and numerous $\theta$-defensin isoforms have been identified in granulocytes of rhesus macaques and Olive baboons. Several mammalian $\alpha$- and $\beta$-defensins, genetically related to $\theta$-defensins, have proinflammatory and immune-activating properties that bridge innate and acquired immunity. In the current study we analyzed the immunoregulatory properties of rhesus $\theta$-defensins 1-5 (RTDs 1-5). RTD-1, the most abundant $\theta$-defensin in macaques, reduced the levels of TNF, IL-1$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, and IL-8 secreted by blood leukocytes stimulated by several TLR agonists. RTDs 1-5 suppressed levels of soluble TNF released by bacteria- or LPS-stimulated blood leukocytes and THP-1 monocytes. Despite their highly conserved conformation and amino acid sequences, the anti-TNF activities of RTDs 1-5 varied by as much as 10-fold. Systemically administered RTD-1 was non-toxic for BALB/c mice, and escalating intravenous doses were well tolerated and non-immunogenic in adult chimpanzees. The peptide was highly stable in serum and plasma. Single dose administration of RTD-1 at 5 mg/kg significantly improved survival of BALB/c mice with E. coli peritonitis and cecal ligation-and-puncture induced polymicrobial sepsis. Peptide treatment reduced serum levels of several inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in bacteremic animals. Collectively, these results indicate that the anti-inflammatory properties of $\theta$-defensins in vitro and in vivo are mediated by the suppression of numerous proinflammatory cytokines and blockade of TNF release may be a primary effect.},

A single injection of 5 mgml(-1) of beta-glucan 6 days before challenge also enhanced significantly the survival against the infection. The treatment with beta-glucan increased the myelomonocytic cell population in the kidney at 6h postchallenge with A. hydrophila. Moreover it enhanced the ability of kidney cells to kill A. hydrophila. beta-glucan did not affect the expression of TNFalpha or IL-1 beta but seemed to modulate IFNgamma and chemokine expression in kidney.},

@article{Huising2006,
abstract = {Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is the founding member of a rapidly growing family of heterodimeric cytokines. It consists of two subunits, designated p35 and p40 that together constitute a disulphide-linked heterodimeric cytokine. IL-12 is well known for its prominent role in both the early innate immune response and the skewing of the ensuing acquired immune response towards Th1. Here, we report the presence of IL-12p35 and three highly distinct IL-12p40 genes in common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The carp is a bony fish species genetically similar to the zebrafish, but its substantially larger body size facilitates immunological studies. A comparison of IL-12p35 genes of mammalian and non-mammalian species reveals the presence of a duplicated exon that is unique to the mammalian lineage. The organisation of the three carp IL-12p40 genes is similar to that of higher vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses that include the p40-related subunits of other composite cytokines confirm the presence of three genuine IL-12p40 genes in carp and indicate that they are evolutionary ancient and possibly not restricted to bony fishes. The orthology of the different carp p40 subunits to mammalian IL-12p40 is further evident from the conservation of key residues involved in the formation of intra- and interchain disulphide bridges and the tight interlocking topology between p35 and p40. The expression of each of the carp IL-12p40 genes differs profoundly, constitutively as well as in response to in vitro stimulation of carp macrophages. Collectively, the presence of multiple and substantially different IL-12 genes signifies a considerable expansion of the vertebrate heterodimeric cytokine family.},

abstract = {The objective of the present study was to determine the action of $\beta$-glucans as feed additives on the gene expression profile of some inflammatory-related cytokines from common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) during the early stages of a non-lethal bacterial infection with Aeromonas salmonicida. $\beta$-glucan (MacroGard(®)), was administered daily to carp (6 mg per kg body weight) in the form of supplemented commercial food pellets for 14 days prior to infection. Control and treated fish were then intraperitoneally injected with PBS or 4×10(8) bacteria per fish and were sampled at time 0 and 6h, 12h, 1 day, 3 days and 5 days post-injection. Head kidney and gut were collected and the gene expression patterns for tnf$\alpha$1, tnf$\alpha$2, il1$\beta$, il6 and il10 were analyzed by quantitative PCR. Results obtained showed that treatment with $\beta$-glucans generally down-regulated the expression of all measured genes when compared to their corresponding controls. After injection, highest changes in the gene expression levels were obtained at 6h; particularly, in head kidney there was higher up-regulation of tnfa1 and tnfa2 in infected fish fed $\beta$-glucans in comparison to control feed; however, in gut there was a significant down-regulation of tnf$\alpha$1, tnf$\alpha$2, il1$\beta$ and il6 in infected fish fed $\beta$-glucans. Analysis of carp specific antibodies against A. salmonicida 30 days after injection revealed their levels were reduced in the infected $\beta$-glucan group. In conclusion, a diet supplemented with $\beta$-glucan (MacroGard(®)) reduced the gene expression levels of some inflammation-related cytokines in common carp. Such a response appears to be dependent of organ studied and therefore the immunostimulant may be preventing an acute and potential dangerous response in gut, whilst enhancing the inflammatory response in head kidney when exposed to A. salmonicida.},

abstract = {The gastrointestinal tract is the largest reservoir of commensal bacteria in the human body, providing nutrients and space for the survival of microbes while concurrently operating mucosal barriers to confine the microbial population. The epithelial cells linked by tight junctions not only physically separate the microbiota from the lamina propria, but also secrete proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species in response to pathogen invasion and metabolic stress and serve as a sentinel to the underlying immune cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that commensal bacteria are involved in various physiological functions in the gut and microbial imbalances (dysbiosis) may cause pathology. Commensal bacteria are involved in the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell turnover, promotion of epithelial restitution and reorganization of tight junctions, all of which are pivotal for fortifying barrier function. Recent studies indicate that aberrant bacterial lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling in gut mucosa may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis. Our perception of enteric commensals has now changed from one of opportunistic pathogens to active participants in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. This review attempts to explain the dynamic interaction between the intestinal epithelium and commensal bacteria in disease and health status.},

abstract = {In fish, like in mammals, an intimate communication between the nervous, endocrine and immune systems has been observed. This bidirectional communication is possible thanks to the molecular signals synthesized by cells and tissues of the three systems are similar or in some cases identical. This intimate interrelation is fundamental, among other factors to cope, in coordinated and effective manner, with the stress situations. Stress can be defined as any situation that puts the organism under the conditions outside the stable or normal physiological range (extreme diseases, changes in the environmental conditions, etc.). The changes in the three regulatory systems that the stress situation generates as a response to this situation is known generically as the general adaptation syndrome (GAS). The stress situations in fish and the mammals keep great similarities, although there exist differences in terms of the organs involved and the response time, being this, an important factor for the recovery of the homeostasis. The parameters used to identify a stressed fish are the ones related to the different response phases after stress: primary response (adrenalin and cortisol), secondary (glucose, lactate and ions of the plasma) and the proteins of acute phase (APP). In addition, immune parameters like phagoctytosis indicators, lytic enzymes of the alternative system of the complement, the aglutinines and precipitines (opsonines, mainly lectines), the natural antibodies, the anti-bacterial cytokines, chemokines and peptides, may be indicative of stress episodes. All of it sows great relevance from the economic point of view, inasmuch as the industrial production of fishing resources (fish farms) anywhere in the world shows greater economic importance due to the growth of their demand and to the increasing quality of the commercial product},

abstract = {In order to determine the efficacy and immunoreversal effect of the 4 dietary immunomodulators, viz. lactoferrin, beta-1,3 glucan, levamisole and vitamin C, on disease resistance of a commercially important catfish, Clarias batrachus, fish were fed diets supplemented with various levels of these substances in 2 subgroups, healthy and immunocompromised, during a 30 d trial. An artificial immunosuppressive state was induced by giving 3 intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of cyclophosphamide (CYP) at a dose level of 200 mg kg(-1) body weight at 1 wk intervals in the immunocompromised vaccinated subgroup and 3 consecutive injections 3 d before challenge in the immunocompromised non-vaccinated subgroup. On the first day of the experiment, the fish were vaccinated against a formalin-killed Aeromonas hydrophila bacterin. After 30 d, antibody titre (as measured through bacterial agglutination titre) and disease resistance against A. hydrophila were determined. The results demonstrate that all 4 immunomodulators were capable of significantly (p < 0.05) enhancing the specific immune response; this was evident through raised antibody titre and protection against A. hydrophila in both healthy and immunocompromised vaccinated subgroups compared to their respective controls. Similarly, all 4 substances significantly raised the survival rates in immunocompromised and healthy non-vaccinated fish. Thus, these substances were capable of reducing the immunosuppression induced by CYP injections in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated fish compared to their respective controls. Among the 4 substances studied, beta-1,3 glucan was found to be the most effective immunomodulator, followed by levamisole, lactoferrin and vitamin C in Asian catfish. Therefore, the results support the introduction of these substances into the diet of fish grown in farms under immunosuppressive/stressful conditions in order to enhance protection against infection and offer economic benefits.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of feeding rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) peptidoglycan (PG) enriched diets on antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression. Fish were divided into 5 groups and fed diets containing 0, 5, 10, 50 and 100 mg PG/Kg, and sampled 1, 7 and 14 days later. The expression of eight AMP genes (four defensins, two cathelicidins and two liver expressed AMPs) was determined in skin, gill, gut and liver, tissues important for first lines of defence or production of acute phase proteins. Up-regulation of many AMPs was found after feeding the PG enriched diets, with sequential expression seen over the time course studied, where defensins were typically expressed early and cathelicidins and LEAPs later on. A number of clear differences in AMP responsiveness between the tissues examined were also apparent. Of the four PG concentrations used, 5 mg PG/Kg did not always elicit AMP gene induction or to the same degree as seen with the other diets. The three higher dose groups generally showed similar trends although differences in fold change were more pronounced in the 50 and 100 mg PG/Kg groups. Curiously several AMPs were down-regulated after 14 days of feeding in gills, gut and liver. Nevertheless, overall the PG enriched diets had a positive effect on AMP expression. Further investigations now need to be undertaken to confirm whether this higher AMP gene expression correlates with protection against common bacterial diseases and if PG enriched diets have value as a means to temporarily boost the piscine immune system.},

abstract = {The intestinal microbiota is composed of hundreds of species of bacteria, fungi and protozoa and is critical for numerous biological processes, such as nutrient acquisition, vitamin production, and colonization resistance against bacterial pathogens. We studied the role of the intestinal microbiota on host resistance to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium-induced colitis. Using multiple antibiotic treatments in 129S1/SvImJ mice, we showed that disruption of the intestinal microbiota alters host susceptibility to infection. Although all antibiotic treatments caused similar increases in pathogen colonization, the development of enterocolitis was seen only when streptomycin or vancomycin was used; no significant pathology was observed with the use of metronidazole. Interestingly, metronidazole-treated and infected C57BL/6 mice developed severe pathology. We hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infectious colitis without affecting the ability of S. Typhimurium to colonize the intestine. Indeed, different antibiotic treatments caused distinct shifts in the intestinal microbiota prior to infection. Through fluorescence in situ hybridization, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, and real-time PCR, we showed that there is a strong correlation between the intestinal microbiota composition before infection and susceptibility to Salmonella-induced colitis. Members of the Bacteroidetes phylum were present at significantly higher levels in mice resistant to colitis. Further analysis revealed that Porphyromonadaceae levels were also increased in these mice. Conversely, there was a positive correlation between the abundance of Lactobacillus sp. and predisposition to colitis. Our data suggests that different members of the microbiota might be associated with S. Typhimurium colonization and colitis. Dissecting the mechanisms involved in resistance to infection and inflammation will be critical for the development of therapeutic and preventative measures against enteric pathogens.},

abstract = {Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), also termed endotoxins, considered to be a major virulence factor, are responsible for the lethal effects and clinical manifestations of diseases in humans and animals. Higher animals are extremely sensitive to endotoxin even at low doses but lower vertebrates like fish are often resistant to endotoxic shock. Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 is mainly involved in the activation of the immune system by LPS through the specific recognition of its endotoxin (Lipid A) moiety. Although several Toll-like receptors are present in fish, those molecules specifically involved in TLR-4 mediated endotoxin recognition have not been fully established in different fish species. Despite this, LPS has the potency to express cytokines, acute-phase proteins and also exerts immunological, pathological, physiological, immuno-endocrinological and neuro-immunological effects in several fish species. The immunostimulating effects of endotoxin by triggering various immune parameters such as T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and complement systems have been established in teleosts. This article reviews the multiple biological effects of endotoxin which will further strengthen the knowledge among researchers on various aspects of endotoxin in lower vertebrates, particularly in the piscine system.},

abstract = {Multiple sequence alignments are fundamental to many sequence analysis methods. Most alignments are computed using the progressive alignment heuristic. These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

abstract = {The immune response against bacterial pathogens has been widely studied in teleosts and it is evident that survival chances differ significantly within a host population. Identification of indicators for susceptibility and responsiveness will improve our understanding of this host-pathogen interaction. The present work shows that the transcripts of cytokine genes in blood cells sampled three days post-infection was significantly higher in fish which obtained a high bacteriemia and died at later time points when compared to both non-infected control fish and infected fish that survived the infection. Rainbow trout were infected by bath challenge in a bacterial suspension (LD(60) dose, 1.8 × 10(9) CFU/ml Yersiniaruckeri for 1 h) and subsequently transferred to individual aquaria for 30 days of observation. Blood samples were analyzed for presence of Y. ruckeri both by culture and quantitative RT real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and transcript levels of 28 genes encoding molecules which are important in the immune response. The transcript levels of a number of central cytokines, chemokines and cytokine receptors (IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-$\alpha$, IL-receptor II) were significantly increased in infected fish that died later. In addition, a significantly higher amount of Y. ruckeri was found in the blood of the fish that died when compared to survivors. The study indicates that highly susceptible trout obtain an early heavy septicemia infection, which elicits a high up-regulation of the transcript of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, less susceptible fish are protected by other factors and contract merely a weak non-lethal infection eliciting no or a weak cytokine response.},

abstract = {This study was performed to determine the efficacy of three immunomodulators viz., $\beta$-1,3 glucan, chitosan and raffinose on the innate immune response of koi, Cyprinus carpio koi. Kois were divided into 4 groups and each group was fed with diets supplemented with or without immunostimulant for 56 days. Total leukocyte counts (WBC), the non-specific humoral (lysozyme, alternative complement pathway and superoxide dismutase) and cellular (phagocytic capacity and respiratory burst activity) responses were determined and compared with controls (no supplement) after 7, 14, 21 and 56 days of feeding. The results of 8 weeks feeding trial showed that $\beta$-1,3 glucan supplementation significantly enhanced koi growth, whereas other immunostimulants did not. Variation in the levels of responses was evident among different supplements. Compared with chitosan or raffinose, $\beta$-1,3 glucan could maintain the immunity of kois at a higher level during the experimental period. However, continuously applying $\beta$-1,3 glucan, chitosan or raffinose into the diet caused immunity fatigue in koi. No significant change in alternative complement pathway (ACP) activity was observed for any of the three supplements over the four different periods. After feeding for 14 days, the total leukocyte count (WBC), respiratory burst activity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of the kois fed with chitosan or raffinose continuously remained relatively unchanged, subsequently decreased on the 56th day, but SOD did not. Meanwhile, lysozyme activity was no longer significantly higher on the 7th day, and for phagocytic capacity on the 14th day. After 56 days, these three immunostimulants groups also exhibited a decrease in the cumulative symptom rates compared to the controls when challenged with Aeromonas veronii. These results indicated that dietary intake containing immunostimulants could enhance the immune responses of koi and improve its resistance to infection by A.veronii. Especially supplementation with $\beta$-1,3 glucan to the kois for 56 days showed considerable improvement in the growth, survival and immune response of the kois.},

abstract = {Soyabean meal (SBM)-induced enteritis in the distal intestine of the teleost Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and other salmonids may be considered a model for diet-related mucosal disorders in other animals and man. The role of the intestinal microbiota in its pathogenesis was explored. Compared to diets containing fishmeal (FM) as the sole protein source, responses to extracted SBM or the prebiotic inulin, with or without oxytetracycline (OTC) inclusion, were studied following a 3-week feeding trial. Intestinal microbiota, organosomatic indices and histology, as well as immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and caspase-3-positive cells in the distal intestine, were studied. Distal intestine somatic indices (DISI) were higher in inulin and lower in SBM compared to FM-fed fish. The low DISI caused by SBM corresponded with histological changes, neither of which was affected by OTC, despite a significant decrease in adherent bacteria count. Image analysis of PCNA-stained sections showed a significant increase in the proliferative compartment length in SBM-fed fish, accompanied by apparent increases in reactivity to HSP70 and caspase-3 along the mucosal folds, indicating induction of cellular repair and apoptosis, respectively. Fish fed the SBM diet had higher total number as well as a more diverse population composition of adherent bacteria in the distal intestine. Thus SBM-induced enteritis is accompanied by induction of distal intestinal epithelial cell protective responses and changes in microbiota. Putative involvement of bacteria in the inflammatory response merits further investigation.},

However, firm evidence supporting this remains lacking. In this study, we clearly demonstrated that immunization of female zebrafish with the hapten-carrier complex, trinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (TNP-BSA), induced a significant increase in anti-TNP antibody production in the mothers, which in turn induced a marked increase in anti-TNP antibody level in their eggs. Microinjection of anti-zebrafish IgM antibody into early embryos (to neutralize endogenous antibody action) resulted in a remarkable decrease in the resistance of recipient embryos to pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila, whereas injection of BSA or anti-$\beta$-actin monoclonal antibody into the same stage embryos had little effect on their resistance to the pathogen. Moreover, the content of endogenous antibodies in eggs was clearly correlated with their antibacterial activity against A. hydrophila. This is the first report showing that maternally transferred antibodies in fish can protect early embyros/larvae from the attack of pathogens like A. hydrophila.},

After 1, 2 and 4 weeks, serum complement titres, as a humoral parameter, and phagocytic, respiratory burst, myeloperoxidase and natural cytotoxic activities of head-kidney leucocytes, as cellular parameters, were evaluated. The results showed that yeast supplements enhanced all the latter responses, but not the humoral response. This enhancement was dose-dependent except for the cytotoxic activity that was only stimulated by the lower dose of yeast assayed. As yeast cell walls are able to enhance the seabream cellular innate immune response, these results support the possible use of whole yeast as natural inmunostimulants in common fish diets.},

The transcript contains an open reading frame of 294 nucleotides that translates into a 97 amino acid putative peptide, with 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of 171 and 453 nucleotides, respectively. As with previously sequenced lamprey and flounder genes, the trout amino acid sequence lacks the typical ELR motif upstream of the first pair of cysteines, where DLR is present. The trout IL-8 gene contains four exons divided by three short introns of 341, 247 and 292bp, and occupies 1824bp of genomic DNA. RT-PCR reveals a low level constitutive expression of the IL-8 homologue in many tissues, including spleen, heart, liver, head kidney and gill. Expression was not detectable in the brain. Whilst no apparent affect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on IL-8 expression was observed in vivo, stimulation of a trout macrophage cell line (RTS-11) with either LPS or poly I:C did result in clear up-regulation of IL-8 expression, detectable by RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis.},

abstract = {The skin of fish is the first line of defense against pathogens and parasites. The skin transcriptome of the Atlantic salmon is poorly characterized, and currently only 2,089 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) out of a total of half a million sequences are generated from skin-derived cDNA libraries. The primary aim of this study was to enhance the transcriptomic knowledge of salmon skin by using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, namely the Roche-454 platform. An equimolar mixture of high-quality RNA from skin and epidermal samples of salmon reared in either freshwater or seawater was used for 454-sequencing. This technique yielded over 600,000 reads, which were assembled into 34,696 isotigs using Newbler. Of these isotigs, 12 \% had not been sequenced in Atlantic salmon, hence representing previously unreported salmon mRNAs that can potentially be skin-specific. Many full-length genes have been acquired, representing numerous biological processes. Mucin proteins are the main structural component of mucus and we examined in greater detail the sequences we obtained for these genes. Several isotigs exhibited homology to mammalian mucins (MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC5B). Mucin mRNAs are generally >10 kbp and contain large repetitive units, which pose a challenge towards full-length sequence discovery. To date, we have not unearthed any full-length salmon mucin genes with this dataset, but have both N- and C-terminal regions of a mucin type 5. This highlights the fact that, while NGS is indeed a formidable tool for sequence data mining of non-model species, it must be complemented with additional experimental and bioinformatic work to characterize some mRNA sequences with complex features.},

abstract = {The application of immunostimulants may be a cost-effective practice in production of delicate and fragile fish fry since it may confer disease resistance. Bath administration to fish fry is considered an ideal delivery route for mass manipulation since there is no need for individual handling. In the current study, rainbow trout fry were bathed with three different immunostimulants: Plasmid DNA, lactoferrin and beta-glucan at two different doses (0.1 microM and 1.0 microM) for 45 min, four times with an interval of 1 week. Ten fish per treatment group were sampled, and RNA of pooled tissues consisting of eye, tongue, skin, gill, thymus, spleen, head kidney, liver, small and large intestine were isolated from the fish obtained at first, second and fourth bathing (24 and 72 h post-bathing). Before cDNA transcription, two parallel samples were pooled giving a total of 5 parallels in each treatment group. Results showed that plasmid DNA and lactoferrin as well as beta-glucan treated fish possessed higher gene expression with regard to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta after the first bathing, especially 24 h post-bathing in the high-dose groups. This indicates that bath delivery of immunostimulants can induce pro-inflammatory responses. No significant changes of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A transcripts, compared to the respective controls, were observed. Gene expression levels in the immunostimulated fish after the fourth bathing did not show significant differences compared to controls.},

Toll-like receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors serve as PRRs that recognize different but overlapping microbial components. They are expressed in different cellular compartments such as the cell surface, endosome, lysosome or cytoplasm and activate specific signaling pathways that lead to expression of genes that tailor immune responses to particular microbes. This review summarizes recent insights into pathogen sensing by these PRRs and their signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Using an oligonucleotide primer based on a partial goldfish inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) sequence, a complete carp iNOS cDNA was isolated from an activated carp phagocyte cDNA library. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence analysis indicate that carp iNOS encodes a 1,127-amino acid protein with 57\% sequence identity to human iNOS. Like mammalian NOSs, carp iNOS protein contains putative binding sites for heme, tetrahydrobiopterin, calmodulin, flavine mononucleotide, flavine adenine dinucleotide, and NADPH. Phylogenetic analysis, using neighbor joining, showed that the carp iNOS protein clustered together with the other vertebrate iNOS proteins. Inducibility of carp iNOS was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction after stimulation of carp phagocytes with lipopolysaccharide or the protozoan blood flagellate Trypanoplasma borreli. These stimulators produced high amounts of nitric oxide that were toxic for T. borreli in vitro. The nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB was shown to play a role in the induction of iNOS transcription.},

Increased expression of iNOS poststimulation with LPS was found, and suggests that it is a functional enzyme in goldfish macrophages, supporting the view that iNOS regulation is pretranslational. The nucleotide sequence translated in one reading frame with no stop codons to produce a partial peptide containing 164 amino acids, with highest homology (85\%) to a recently identified rainbow trout iNOS sequence. The peptide translation also gave an insight into the conservation of binding motifs, since two cofactor binding sites were present in the amplified PCR product (FMN and calmodulin). In addition, a 42 aa motif present in the region just upstream of the FMN binding motif of mammalian endothelial and neuronal NOS isoforms was absent in the translation, in agreement with every published sequence for iNOS. Finally, the translation was used to construct an unrooted phylogenetic tree.},

Full sibling fish from four unrelated families, each consisting of individuals derived from the mating of one male and one female belonging to a breeding program, were fed diets containing either vegetable proteins or vegetable oils for two months in comparison to a control diet consisting of only fish protein and fish oil. Two parallel approaches were applied on the same samples: transcriptionally active bacterial populations were examined based on RNA analysis and were compared with bacterial populations obtained from DNA analysis. Comparison of temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) profiles from DNA and RNA showed important differences, indicating that active bacterial populations were better described by RNA analysis. Results showed that some bacterial groups were significantly (P<0.05) associated with specific families, indicating that microbiota composition may be influenced by the host. In addition, the effect of diet on microbiota composition was dependent on the trout family.},

abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to understand the microbial community of intestinal contents and mucosal layer in the intestine of rainbow trout by means of culture-dependent conventional and independent molecular techniques.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-one culturable microbial phylotypes, and 39 sequences from 16S rRNA and two from 18S rRNA genes, were retrieved. Aeromonadaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae representatives were the dominant cultured bacteria. Genomic DNA isolated from intestinal contents and mucus was used to generate 104 random clones, which were grouped into 32 phylotypes at 99\% minimum similarity, most of which were affiliated with Proteobacteria (>70\% of the total). However, unlike library C (intestinal contents), the phyla Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria were not found in intestinal mucus (library M), indicating that the microbiota in the gut mucus was different from that of the intestinal contents. Twelve sequences were retrieved from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, and dominant bands were mostly related to Clostridium.

CONCLUSIONS: Many novel sequences that have not been previously recognized as part of the intestinal flora of rainbow trout were retrieved.

SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The fish gut harbours a larger bacterial diversity than previously recognized, and the diversity of gut mucus is different from that of intestinal contents.},

abstract = {During the analysis of Ig superfamily members within the available rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) EST gene index, we identified a unique Ig heavy-chain (IgH) isotype. cDNAs encoding this isotype are composed of a typical IgH leader sequence and a VDJ rearranged segment followed by four Ig superfamily C-1 domains represented as either membrane-bound or secretory versions. Because teleost fish were previously thought to encode and express only two IgH isotypes (IgM and IgD) for their humoral immune repertoire, we isolated all three cDNA isotypes from a single homozygous trout (OSU-142) to confirm that all three are indeed independent isotypes. Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis indicates that this previously undescribed divergent isotype is restricted to bony fish, thus we have named this isotype "IgT" (tau) for teleost fish. Genomic sequence analysis of an OSU-142 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone positive for all three IgH isotypes revealed that IgT utilizes the standard rainbow trout V(H) families, but surprisingly, the IgT isotype possesses its own exclusive set of D(H) and J(H) elements for the generation of diversity. The IgT D and J segments and tau constant (C) region genes are located upstream of the D and J elements for IgM, representing a genomic IgH architecture that has not been observed in any other vertebrate class. All three isotypes are primarily expressed in the spleen and pronephros (bone marrow equivalent), and ontogenically, expression of IgT is present 4 d before hatching in developing embryos.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the control of lactococcosis as well as to assess the impact of probiotics on the expression of immune-related genes in the head kidney and intestine of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, were administered orally at 10⁶ CFU g⁻¹ feed to fish for 36 days. Twenty-one days after the start of the feeding period, fish were challenged with Lactococcus garvieae. Only the fish fed the diet containing Lb. plantarum showed significantly (P < 0.05) improved protection against L. garvieae compared to the control. Subsequently, real-time PCR was employed to determine the mRNA levels of IL-1$\beta$, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-$\alpha$ in the head kidney, and IL-8, Tlr5 and IgT in the intestine of the control and Lb. plantarum groups. IL-1$\beta$, IL-10 and TNF-$\alpha$ gene expression were significantly up-regulated by Lb. plantarum. Moreover, the mRNA levels of IL-10, IL-8 and IgT were significantly higher in the Lb. plantarum group after L. garvieae infection, suggesting that Lb. plantarum can stimulate the immune response of rainbow trout. PCR-DGGE revealed no detectable levels of the probiotics or the pathogen present on the distal intestinal mucosa. These findings demonstrate that direct probiotic-host interactions with the intestine are not always necessary to induce host stimulatory responses which ultimately enhance disease resistance. Furthermore, as L. garvieae did not colonise the intestinal tract, and therefore likely did not infect via this route, the antagonistic properties of the probiotic candidate towards L. garvieae were likely of little influence in mediating the improved disease resistance which could be attributed to the elevated immunological response.},

Using RT-PCR and RACE, a full length cDNA sequence of the hepcidin like antimicrobial peptide was determined. The complete hepcidin cDNA Hepc2 is 581 bases and contains an ORF of 258 bases with a coding capacity of 86 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence, which shares eight cysteines at the identical conserved positions, and gene organisation are conserved between Japan sea bass and other fish species. The predicted molecular weight of the peptide is 9.4 kDa. The 3'-untranslated region is composed of 225 bp with a polyadenylation signal AATAAA sequence appearing at 189 nt and the poly(A) tail at 212 nt downstream of stop codon TGA. The predicted signal peptide cleavage site of its deduced peptide is between codons 24 and 25. Japan sea bass hepcidin-like genomic DNA hepc2 sequence including upstream and downstream regions was composed of two introns and three exons. The cloned 173-bp upstream sequence of Japan sea bass hepcidin-like gene contains putative regulatory elements and several binding motifs for transcription factors. High homologies with hepcidin cDNAs and peptides of white bass (Morone chrysops), human and other fish were shown. Hepc2 of Lateolabrax japonicus is a new member of the hepcidin gene family.},

abstract = {Gene expression of a number of cytokines in the intestine of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was investigated after challenge with a pathogenic strain of Aeromonas salmonicida. Fish were exposed to A. salmonicida by immersion in a bacterial suspension (bath challenge) and tissue samples of the distal and proximal intestine were collected at days 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 post-exposure. Head kidney tissue was also collected to assess the effect in a systemic immune tissue. A classic profile of pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation was observed in the proximal intestine of fish infected by bath challenge, as determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of IL-1beta, IL-8, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma was increased in the proximal intestine. TGF-beta was significantly decreased in the distal intestine. In the head kidney, infection with A. salmonicida by bath challenge caused decreased expression levels of IL-1beta, IL-8, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta. The results are discussed in the context of potential immune mechanisms in the gut to prevent infection.},

abstract = {Local or systemic stem cell delivery has the potential to promote repair of a variety of damaged or degenerated tissues. Although various stem cell sources have been investigated for bone repair, few comparative reports exist, and cellular distribution and viability postimplantation remain key issues. In this study, we quantified the ability of tissue-engineered constructs containing either human fetal or adult stem cells to enhance functional repair of nude rat critically sized femoral defects. After 12 weeks, defects treated with cell-seeded polymer scaffolds had significantly higher bone ingrowth and torsional strength compared to those receiving acellular scaffolds, although there were no significant differences between the cell sources. Next, stem cells were labeled with fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) in an attempt to noninvasively track their distribution after delivery on scaffolds. Clear fluorescence was observed at implantation sites throughout the study; however, beginning 7-10 days after surgery, signals were also observed at contralateral sites treated with acellular QD-free scaffolds. Although immunostaining for human nuclei revealed retention of some cells at the implantation site, no human cells were detected in the control limb defects. Additional histological analysis of implantation and control defect tissues revealed macrophages containing endocytosed QDs. Furthermore, QD-labeling appeared to diminish transplanted cell function resulting in reduced healing responses. In summary, augmentation of polymeric scaffolds with stem cells derived from fetal and adult tissues significantly enhanced healing of large segmental bone defects; however, QD labeling of stem cells eliminated the observed therapeutic effect and failed to conclusively track stem cell location long-term in vivo.},

abstract = {Skin exudates of rainbow trout contain a potent 13.6 kDa anti-microbial protein which, from partial internal amino acid sequencing, peptide mass fingerprinting, matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization MS and amino acid analysis, seems to be histone H2A, acetylated at the N-terminus. The protein, purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography, exhibits powerful anti-bacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the submicromolar range. Kinetic analysis revealed that at a concentration of 0.3 microM all test bacteria lose viability after 30 min incubation. Weaker activity is also displayed against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The protein is salt-sensitive and has no haemolytic activity towards trout erythrocytes at concentrations below 0.3 microM. Reconstitution of the protein in a planar lipid bilayer strongly disturbs the membrane but does not form stable ion channels, indicating that its anti-bacterial activity is probably not due to pore-forming properties. This is the first report to show that, in addition to its classical function in the cell, histone H2A has extremely strong anti-microbial properties and could therefore help contribute to protection against bacterial invasion.},

abstract = {The main cellular responses of innate immunity are phagocytic activity and the respiratory burst, which produces a high amount of reactive oxygen species. Natural killer enhancing factor (NKEF) belongs to the peroxiredoxin family that has an antioxidant function and enhances cytotoxic cell activity. This molecule may play a key role in macrophage and cytotoxic cell communication during the innate immune response of fish against pathogens. In fish, the NKEF gene has been characterized in some species as showing an up-regulation in infected fish, suggesting a trigger effect upon NK-like cells. To detect and localize this molecule in salmonids at protein level, a monospecific polyclonal antibody was generated. A probable NKEF-like protein epitope region was identified and characterized using bioinformatic tools, and the sequence was chemically synthesized using Fmoc strategy, analysed by RP-HPLC and its molecular weight confirmed by mass spectrometry. The synthetic peptide was immunized and antibodies from ascitic fluid were obtained. The resulting antibody is a versatile tool for detecting NKEF by different immune techniques such as ELISA, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Analysis of NKEF-like protein is a useful method for characterizing immune properties of this molecule in fish during response to pathogens.},

Closely related hepcidin genes and peptides also have been identified in other mammals, amphibians, and a number of fish species. We hypothesize that hepcidin, the iron-regulatory hormone in humans, may have evolved from an antimicrobial peptide in fishes. In this review we will highlight the evidence that indicates hepcidin evolved from an antimicrobial peptide to an iron-regulatory hormone in vertebrate evolution. This evidence includes the discovery of hepcidin as an antimicrobial peptide and iron-regulatory hormone, structural comparison of mammalian hepcidins and nonmammalian hepcidins, and the cellular and molecular evidence indicating that, while some fish hepcidins may serve only as antimicrobial peptides, other fish and amphibian hepcidins may function as iron regulators.},

The development of functional T-cells from thymocytes is a crucial step in the development of a functional vertebrate immune system and whilst recent advances in molecular and developmental biology have advanced our understanding of T-cell development, they have also provided potential model species across the vertebrate phyla including the zebrafish (Danio rerio). However, this species is one of more than 20,000 species of fish that could assist in elucidating the development of the vertebrate thymus and, consequently, the evolution of the vertebrate immune response. In this paper we review the knowledge of the teleost thymus through the organogenesis and development studies in teleosts together with advances in molecular and functional approaches. Where necessary we will combine this knowledge with that obtained in higher vertebrates.},

The labeling protocol employs an immunohistochemical process with a panneuronal marker (PGP 9.5) as the primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 as the fluorescing secondary antibody. Imaging was done using a confocal laser scanning microscope, which produced exceptionally detailed three-dimensional images of nerve endings and transiting nerve fibers from thick sections of wrist joint ligaments obtained from human cadavers. The protocol provided a practical postmortem window for specimen acquisition and processing without significant apparent worsening of image quality. The images produced are resistant to fading with repeated exposure to a fluorescent light source, which gives many opportunities for observation. Background staining is minimal, producing high contrast labeling of target tissues, which, in turn, enhances image analysis.},

abstract = {The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) super-family is a group of important cytokines involved in inflammation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and the general stimulation of the immune system. The TNF gene has been cloned in some bony fish; however, its counterparts are still unidentified in the majority of fish species. In this study, we cloned gTNF-1 and gTNF-2 from the orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), an economically important farmed fish. Both genes include 4 exons and 3 introns and encoded 253 and 241 amino acid proteins with a molecular weight of approximately 27 and 26 kDa, respectively. The identity of the putative amino acid sequences between gTNF-1 and gTNF-2 was only 38\%. The positions of cysteine residues, a protease cleavage site, and a transmembrane domain sequence derived from gTNF-1 and gTNF-2 were similar to those in other fish and mammalian TNF-$\alpha$. The mRNA expression levels of the 2 gTNF molecules were evaluated in unstimulated/stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes, various organs, and fish larvae. Following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, gTNF-2 was expressed at higher levels, was up-regulated more quickly, and was more sensitive to the immune response than gTNF-1. gTNF-1 was constitutively expressed in the thymus, brain, and spleen, but it was also expressed in the heart, head kidney, and trunk kidney after LPS stimulation. gTNF-2 was constitutively expressed in the thymus, head kidney, trunk kidney, spleen, and intestine; further, gTNF-2 was highly expressed in all organs post-LPS stimulation. Finally, the gTNF expression levels were evaluated at various developmental stages in grouper larvae. A higher variation of gTNF expression levels was observed in fish larvae from a contaminated hatchery. This study revealed the different expression patterns of gTNF-1 and gTNF-2. In addition, gTNF-2 was more sensitive to pathogens than gTNF-1; therefore, it may be an appropriate marker for pathogen invasion and the evaluation of the larval rearing environment.},

abstract = {Community-level molecular techniques are widely used in comparative microbial ecology to assess the diversity of microbial communities and their response to changing environments. These include among others denaturing and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE/TGGE), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), length heterogeneity-PCR (LH-PCR), terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (tRFLP) and 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. The amount of data derived from these techniques available in literature is continuously increasing and the lack of a universal way to interpret the raw fingerprint itself makes it difficult to compare between different results. Taking the DGGE technique as an example, we propose a setting-independent theoretical interpretation of the DGGE pattern, based on a straightforward processing on three levels of analysis: (i) the range-weighted richness (Rr) reflecting the carrying capacity of the system, (ii) the dynamics (Dy) reflecting the specific rate of species coming to significance, and (iii) functional organization (Fo), defined through a relation between the structure of a microbial community and its functionality. These Rr, Dy and Fo values, each representing a score to describe a microbial community, can be plotted in a 3D graph. The latter represents a visual ecological interpretation of the initial raw fingerprinting pattern.},

abstract = {Hepcidin is an antimicrobial peptide responsive to bacterial infection. We report the characterization of a virus/double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induction of hepcidin in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Increased level of hepcidin mRNA was observed in trout macrophage RTS11 cells treated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a mimic of viral dsRNA. The induction was also observed in poly I:C-injected trout, demonstrating that it is a bona fide biological response. The induction was not observed in livers or hepatic RTH1B2C cells despite the presence of IFN response. The induction required de novo protein synthesis. Studies on the kinetic relationship among the poly I:C-regulated hepcidin induction and IFN response indicated that the two responses were uncoupled. Interestingly, in RTS11 infected with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, the level of hepcidin was increased as expected but subsequently reduced to below baseline as the infection progressed, whereas IFNs, Mx1 and TLR3 were still increasing.},

abstract = {As physical barriers that separate teleost fish from the external environment, mucosae are also active immunological sites that protect them against exposure to microbes and stressors. In mammals, the sites where antigens are sampled from mucosal surfaces and where stimulation of na\"{\i}ve T and B lymphocytes occurs are known as inductive sites and are constituted by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). According to anatomical location, the MALT in teleost fish is subdivided into gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), skin-associated lymphoid tissue (SALT), and gill-associated lymphoid tissue (GIALT). All MALT contain a variety of leukocytes, including, but not limited to, T cells, B cells, plasma cells, macrophages and granulocytes. Secretory immunoglobulins are produced mainly by plasmablasts and plasma cells, and play key roles in the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis. Until recently, teleost fish B cells were thought to express only two classes of immunoglobulins, IgM and IgD, in which IgM was thought to be the only one responding to pathogens both in systemic and mucosal compartments. However, a third teleost immunoglobulin class, IgT/IgZ, was discovered in 2005, and it has recently been shown to behave as the prevalent immunoglobulin in gut mucosal immune responses. The purpose of this review is to summarise the current knowledge of mucosal immunoglobulins and B cells of fish MALT. Moreover, we attempt to integrate the existing knowledge on both basic and applied research findings on fish mucosal immune responses, with the goal to provide new directions that may facilitate the development of novel vaccination strategies that stimulate not only systemic, but also mucosal immunity.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to underline the physiological role of the antioxidant peroxiredoxin (PRDX) family in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.), a perciform fish extensively cultured in the Mediterranean area. First, extensive BLAST searches were done on the gilthead sea bream cDNA database of the AQUAMAX European Project (www.sigenae.org/iats), and six contigs were unequivocally identified as PRDX1-6 after sequence completion by RT-PCR. The phylogenetic analysis evidenced three major clades corresponding to PRDX1-4 (true 2-Cyst PRDX subclass), PRDX5 (atypical 2-Cys PRDX subclass) and PRDX6 (1-Cys PRDX subclass) that reflected the present hierarchy of vertebrates. However, the PRDX2 branch of modern fish including gilthead sea bream was related to the monophyletic PRDX1 node rather than to PRDX2 cluster of mammals and primitive fish, which probably denotes the acquisition of novel functions through vertebrate evolution. Transcriptional studies by means of quantitative real-time PCR evidenced a ubiquitous PRDX gene expression that was tissue specific for each PRDX isoform. In a second set of transcriptional studies, liver and head kidney were chosen as target tissues in fish challenged with i) the intestinal parasite Enteromyxum leei, ii) a plant oil (VO) diet with deficiencies in essential fatty acids and iii) prolonged exposure to high-rearing densities. These studies showed that PRDX genes were highly and mostly constitutively expressed in the liver and were not affected by dietary intervention or high density. In contrast, head kidney was highly sensitive to the different experimental challenges: significantly lower values were found for PRDX5 in the three trials, for PRDX6 in parasitized and high density fish and for PRDX1 in parasitized and VO fish. PRDX2, 3 and 5 were decreased only in VO, high density and parasitized animals, respectively. These findings would highlight the role of PRDXs as integrative and highly predictive biomarkers of health and welfare in fish and gilthead sea bream in particular.},

abstract = {Poly-$\beta$-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a bacterial energy and carbon storage compound which exhibits a controlling effect on the gastrointestinal microbiota. Its beneficial activities for aquaculture have already been shown in terms of increased disease resistance and growth performance in a number of studies. However, the action of PHB on the intestinal microbial community in the treated animals has not yet been studied in depth. In this research, the effects of PHB on the microbiota composition in the intestinal tract of juvenile sea bass were examined. It was found that fish cohabiting in the same tank were on average 87\% similar regarding the intestinal microbiota. When subjected to the same treatment and environmental conditions but reared in different tanks, the compositions of the enteric communities diverged. The provision of PHB overruled this tank effect by sustaining a microbial core community in the gut that represented 60\% of the total bacterial diversity at the highest PHB level of 10\%. The microbial community compositions converged between replicate tanks upon supplementation of PHB and were characterized by high dynamics and increased evenness. The results are discussed in the framework of hypotheses that try to relate the intestinal microbial community composition to the health status of the host organisms.},

abstract = {The colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is the principal regulator of the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and function of macrophages and their precursors, and has been shown to play a role in the etiology of inflammation. We recently identified a novel mechanism for the control of CSF-1 activity in teleost fish, through the production of an inhibitory soluble form of the CSF-1 receptor (sCSF-1R). Primary goldfish kidney macrophages selectively expressed sCSF-1R during the senescence phase, which corresponds to a defined stage of in vitro culture development where inhibition of macrophage proliferation and apoptotic cell death are prominent. In contrast, primary macrophage cultures undergoing active proliferation displayed low levels of sCSF-1R expression. Addition of purified recombinant sCSF-1R to developing primary macrophage cultures leads to a dose-dependent decrease in macrophage proliferation and inhibits macrophage antimicrobial functions including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and production of reactive oxygen intermediates. Using a goldfish in vivo model of self-resolving peritonitis, we found that sCSF-1R plays a role in the inhibition of inflammation, following an initial acute phase of antimicrobial responses within an inflammatory site. Soluble CSF-1R inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production, inhibits leukocyte recruitment to the inflammatory site and decreases ROS production in a dose-dependent manner. This sCSF-1R-dependent regulation of inflammation appears to be an elegant mechanism for the control of macrophage numbers at inflammatory sites of lower vertebrates. Overall, our results provide new insights into the evolutionary origins of the CSF-1 immune regulatory axis.},

@article{Swain2009,
abstract = {Maternal immunity is of paramount importance for protection of young ones at early stage of life since the immune factors of an immunocompetent female are transferred transplacentally or through colostrum, milk or yolk to an immunologically naive neonate. Both innate and adaptive type of immunity are transferred of from mother to offspring in fishes. These factors include immunoglobulin (Ig)/antibody, complement factors, lysozymes, protease inhibitors like alpha macroglobulin, different types of lectins and serine proteases like molecules. Among different types of Ig viz. IgM, IgD, IgT/IgZ and IgM-IgZ chimera types, IgM is present in most of the teleostean fishes. In teleosts, IgM either as a reduced/breakdown product or monomeric form is usually transferred to the offsprings. The maternally derived IgM usually persists for a limited duration, exhausts within the completion of yolk absorption process, and completely disappears thereafter during larval stages. Maternal transfer of immunity which provides defense to embryo and larvae depends upon the health as well as the immune status of brood fish. The overall health status of brood fish can affect breeding performances, quality seed production and protection of offsprings. However, factors such as age, maturation, reproductive behaviour and nutrition (micro and macro-nutrients) may affect the immunity in brood fishes. Besides these, seasonal changes such as photoperiods, temperature, adverse environmental conditions, and stress conditions like handling, crowding, and water pollution/contamination can also affect the immunity of brood fishes. The maintenance of the brood stock immunity at high level during vitellogenesis and oogenesis, is utmost important for reducing mortalities at larval/post larval stages through maximum/optimum transfer of maternal immunity. Brood stock immunization prior to breeding as well as selective breeding among the disease resistant families might be the ideal criteria for producing quality seed.},

Beta-glucan was extracted from Saccharomyces cervisiae and purified. A virulent strain of the pathogen A. hydrophila was collected from infected fish. Different concentrations of beta-glucan were administered to test animals on day 1, 3 and 5 through different routes (intraperitoneal injection (ip), bathing and oral administration). Control and test animals were challenged by ip injection of LD50 concentration of A. hydrophila on day 7 and mortality was observed and Relative Percent Survival (RPS) was calculated. Intraperitoneal injection of 500 microg of glucan significantly enhanced the RPS; bathing and oral administration of glucan did not influence the RPS. On day 7, test animals injected with 100, 500 and 1000 microg of glucan had a significant increase in total blood leucocyte counts and an increase in the proportion of neutrophils and monocytes. Superoxide anion production by kidney macrophages was also elevated. RT-PCR and northern blot analysis of interleukin-1 mRNA showed elevated expression in kidney on day 7 in fish injected with glucan. Glucan had an adjuvant effect on antibody production as pretreatment by injection of 100-1000 microg glucan/fish resulted in the highest antibody titer against A. hydrophila following vaccination. Classical and alternative complement pathways were not affected by glucan administration by any of the three routes.},

abstract = {The complement system of fish is generally as complex as in mammals, and in addition Teleost fish often possess several genes encoding different subtypes of a given complement component, such as C3-1, C3-3 and C3-4. Initiators of both the classical (C1) and alternative pathway (factor B) have been characterized in the rainbow trout but so far no molecules of the lectin pathway have been identified. Based on the generally accepted idea of complement evolution, which predicts that the alternative pathway predates the two other pathways, and that the lectin pathway developed before the classical, we set out to characterize members of the lectin pathway in fish. We identified and characterized three homologues of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) with a bona fide collectin structure. By means of RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies we found that they were synthesized in the spleen, the anterior intestine and the liver. In the liver, we saw co-expression with mannan-binding lectin associated serine protease (MASP). The MBL homologues 2 and 3 (MBL-H2,3) were also found in the vascular system of the rainbow trout. By means of gel size exclusion chromatography of serum we found that MBL-H2,3 oligomerized heterogeneously from monomers to tetramers of a trimeric collagenous subunit. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies showed that the homologues were more related with MBL than any other collectins, and that two previously characterized trout proteins, designated MBL1 and MBL2, should be reconsidered as MBL candidates.},

abstract = {Summer mortalities of Crassostreagigas are a major concern in oyster aquaculture. They are the result of a complex interaction between the host, pathogens and environmental factors. Oyster genetics have been identified as an essential determinant of oyster susceptibility to summer mortalities. As the capability of oysters to circumvent diseases depends in part on their immune defenses, we aimed to analyze the gene expression and sequence polymorphism of 42 immune related genes in two oyster lines selected for their "High" (H) and "Low" (L) survival to summer mortalities. Results showed that the variability of gene expression and the sequence polymorphism acting on particular genes could enable the discrimination between H and L oyster lines. Besides, a higher sequence polymorphism was observed on the L line affecting 11 of the 42 analyzed genes. By analyzing gene expression, sequence polymorphism and gene copy number of two antimicrobial peptide families (Cg-Defs and Cg-Prp), and an antimicrobial protein (Cg-BPI) on individual oysters, we showed that gene expression and/or sequence polymorphism could also discriminate H and L oyster lines. Finally, we observed a positive correlation between the gene expression and the gene copy number of antimicrobials and that sequence polymorphism could be encoded in the genome. Overall, this study gives new insights in the relationship between oyster immunity and divergent phenotypes, and discusses the potential implication of antimicrobial diversity in oyster survival to summer mortalities.},

abstract = {At the interface between the innate and adaptive immune systems lies the high-output isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2 or iNOS). This remarkable molecular machine requires at least 17 binding reactions to assemble a functional dimer. Sustained catalysis results from the ability of NOS2 to attach calmodulin without dependence on elevated Ca2+. Expression of NOS2 in macrophages is controlled by cytokines and microbial products, primarily by transcriptional induction. NOS2 has been documented in macrophages from human, horse, cow, goat, sheep, rat, mouse, and chicken. Human NOS2 is most readily observed in monocytes or macrophages from patients with infectious or inflammatory diseases. Sustained production of NO endows macrophages with cytostatic or cytotoxic activity against viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, and tumor cells. The antimicrobial and cytotoxic actions of NO are enhanced by other macrophage products such as acid, glutathione, cysteine, hydrogen peroxide, or superoxide. Although the high-output NO pathway probably evolved to protect the host from infection, suppressive effects on lymphocyte proliferation and damage to other normal host cells confer upon NOS2 the same protective/destructive duality inherent in every other major component of the immune response.},

It is difficult, however, to determine when the fish immune system has matured and, accordingly, when the fry can be successfully vaccinated. To establish some general parameters which can correlate the development of protective immunity with maturation of the immune system we review: (i) the appearance of first lympho-haemopoietic cell precursors; (ii) the histological and functional maturation of lymphoid organs; (iii) the relevance of phagocytosis and transport of maternal Ig to eggs for early vaccination; (iv) the appearance of both T-like and B-like cells and their correlation with the development of the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses and (v) the mechanisms which may be involved in the induction of tolerance following early immunization of fry. These data rather than a general rule for vaccination of larval fish indicate that the earliest age (size) that a fish can be vaccinated differs between species and vaccines.},

abstract = {Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the respiratory and digestive tracts are covered by a specialized epithelium, the follicle-associated epithelium, which includes M cells, which are specialized for the uptake and transcytosis of macromolecules and microorganisms. Following transcytosis, antigens are released to cells of the immune system in lymphoid aggregates beneath the epithelium where antigen processing and presentation and stimulation of specific B and T lymphocytes are achieved. Circulation of the lymphoid cells enables their homing to their original, and other, mucosal sites where they exert the effector function. Such a response may be dominated by secretory immunoglobulin A release and may include cytotoxic T lymphocyte action. Binding of particles to the apical M cell membrane may be nonspecific or due to specific interaction between molecules such as integrins and lectins. Exploiting the specific binding to M cells is an aim for mucosal vaccination, for example to increase the efficiency of uptake of an oral vaccine by its conjugation to an M-cell-specific molecule. Alternatively, an M-cell-specific live vector, such as attenuated Salmonella bacteria, may be used to deliver epitopes of other organisms. Mucosal vaccination efficiency may also be enhanced by a temporary increase in the number of M cells. Therefore, investigation of the properties and ontogeny of M cells must be pursued to allow the development of better mucosal vaccines for the future.},

Here, CXC chemokines of the CXCL8-like (CXCa\_L1 and CXCL8\_L2) and CXCL9/10/11-like (CXCb) subset were investigated in carp. Recombinant CXCa\_L1, CXCL8\_L2 and CXCb all stimulated chemotaxis of macrophages and granulocytes in vitro. CXCb also attracted lymphocytes. Distinct effects on phagocyte activation were observed: the CXCL8-like chemokines increase respiratory burst activity, but not nitrite production. The three chemokines differentially induced a moderate increase in IL-1$\beta$, CXCa\_L1 and CXCL8\_L2 gene expression. Intracellular calcium mobilization in granulocytes upon CXCa\_L1 stimulation implies signal transduction through G-protein coupled CXC receptors. Notably, upon intraperitoneal administration, carp CXCL8-like chemokines strongly induced in vivo leukocyte recruitment, including neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, in contrast to CXCb, for which the number of recruited leukocytes was low. The results indicate functional homology for carp CXCL8-like and CXCb chemokines with mammalian CXCL8 and CXCL9-11, respectively.},

abstract = {Two L-rhamnose-binding lectins named STL1 and STL2 were isolated from eggs of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. The apparent molecular masses of purified STL1 and STL2 were estimated to be 84 and 68 kDa, respectively, by gel filtration chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry of these lectins revealed that STL1 was composed of noncovalently linked trimer of 31.4-kDa subunits, and STL2 was noncovalently linked trimer of 21.5-kDa subunits. The minimum concentrations of STL1, a major component, and STL2, a minor component, needed to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes were 9 and 0.2 microg/ml, respectively. The most effective saccharide in the hemagglutination inhibition assay for both STL1 and STL2 was L-rhamnose. Saccharides possessing the same configuration of hydroxyl groups at C2 and C4 as that in L-rhamnose, such as L-arabinose and D-galactose, also inhibited. The amino acid sequence of STL2 was determined by analysis of peptides generated by digestion of the S-carboxamidomethylated protein with Achromobacter protease I or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The STL2 subunit of 195 amino acid residues proved to have a unique polypeptide architecture; that is, it was composed of two tandemly repeated homologous domains (STL2-N and STL2-C) with 52\% internal homology. These two domains showed a sequence homology to the subunit (105 amino acid residues) of D-galactoside-specific sea urchin (Anthocidaris crassispina) egg lectin (37\% for STL2-N and 46\% for STL2-C, respectively). The N terminus of the STL1 subunit was blocked with an acetyl group. However, a partial amino acid sequence of the subunit showed a sequence similarity to STL2. Moreover, STL2 also showed a sequence homology to the ligand binding domain of the vitellogenin receptor. We have also employed surface plasmon resonance biosensor methodology to investigate the interactions between STL2 and major egg yolk proteins from steelhead trout, lipovitellin, and beta'-component, which are known as vitellogenin digests. Interestingly, STL2 showed distinct interactions with both egg yolk proteins. The estimated values for the affinity constant (Ka) of STL2 to lipovitellin and beta' component were 3.44 x 10(6) and 4.99 x 10(6), respectively. These results suggest that the fish egg lectins belong to a new family of animal lectin structurally related to the low density lipoprotein receptor super- family.},

abstract = {The innate immune system uses a variety of germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors that recognize conserved microbial structures or pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as those that occur in the bacterial cell-wall components peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as a family of pattern-recognition receptors in mammals that can discriminate between chemically diverse classes of microbial products. First identified on the basis of sequence similarity with the Drosophila protein Toll, TLRs are members of an ancient superfamily of proteins, which includes related proteins in invertebrates and plants. TLRs activate innate immune defense reactions, such as the release of inflammatory cytokines, but increasing evidence supports an additional critical role for TLRs in orchestrating the development of adaptive immune responses. The sequence similarity between the intracellular domains of the TLRs and the mammalian interleukin-1 and interleukin-18 cytokine receptors reflects the use of a common intracellular signal-transduction cascade triggered by these receptor classes. But more recent findings have demonstrated that there are in fact TLR-specific signaling pathways and cellular responses. Thus, TLRs function as sentinels of the mammalian immune system that can discriminate between diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns and then elicit pathogen-specific cellular immune responses.},

abstract = {The integumental defenses provide a physical and chemical barrier to the attachment and penetration of microbes. Besides the entrapping and sloughing of microbes in the mucus, the latter contains many antibacterial substances including anti-bacterial peptides, lysozyme, lectins and proteases. The gastro-intestinal tract is a hostile environment of acids, bile salts and enzymes able to inactivate and digest many viruses and bacteria. In most cases the integumental defenses are sufficient to protect against even quite virulent organisms which often only produce disease when the integument has been physically damaged. If a microbe gains access to the tissues of the fish, it is met with an array of soluble and cellular defenses. The complement system, present in the blood plasma, plays a central role in recognising bacteria and its activated products may lyse the bacterial cells, initiate inflammation, induce the influx of phagocytes and enhance their phagocytic activity. Complement can be activated directly by bacterial products and constituents and also indirectly by other factors, principally C-reactive protein and lectins, which can also bind to the bacterial surface. Plasma also contains a number of factors which inhibit bacterial growth(e.g. transferrin and anti-proteases) or which are bactericidal e.g. lysozyme. Following the infection of fish with virus pathogens, infected cells produce interferon. This induces antiviral defenses in neighbouring cells which are then protected from becoming infected. Anti-viral cytotoxic cells are able to lyse virally infected cells and thus reduce the rate of multiplication of virus within them. Innate defenses thus provide a pre-existing and fast-acting system of protection which is non-specific and relatively temperature-independent and thus has several advantages over the slow-acting and temperature-dependent specific immune responses.},

The expression levels of two pro-inflammatory genes, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), increased in the peptide-treated RTS11 cells. The peptides did not appear to affect the expression levels of representative genes associated with antigen presentation, interferon response or JAK/STAT signal transduction. Furthermore, the induction of IL-1 beta and COX-2 in RTS11 by lipopolysaccharide was not adversely affected by these three antimicrobial peptides. Overall, the data indicate a pro-inflammatory effect of the three cationic antimicrobial peptides in the inflammatory response of salmonid species, suggesting a potential application of these peptides as immune adjuvant for fish vaccination.},

@article{Terova2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In comparison to higher vertebrates, fish are thought to rely heavily on innate immune system for initial protection against pathogen invasion because their acquired immune system displays a considerably poor immunological memory, and short-lived secondary response. The endogenous antimicrobial polypeptides (AMPPs) directly and rapidly killing pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses are included within the realm of innate defenses. In addition to piscidins, AMPPs that in recent years have been shown to be commonly linked to innate defense, are histones and their polypeptide fragments, and peptides derived from the respiratory protein hemoglobin. There is evidence that a number of stresses lead to significant regulation of AMPPs and thus their monitoring could be a highly sensitive measure of health status and risk of an infectious disease outbreak, which is a major impediment to the continued success of virtually all aquaculture enterprises and is often the most significant cause of economic losses.

RESULTS: We firstly isolated and deposited in Genbank database the cDNA sequences encoding for hemoglobin-$\beta$-like protein (Hb-LP) [GeneBank: JN410659], H2B histone-like protein 1 (HLP1) GenBank: JN410660], and HLP2 [GenBank: JN410661]. The "de novo" prediction of the three-dimensional structures for each protein is presented. Phylogenetic trees were constructed on Hb-LP, HLP1, and HLP2 sequences of sea bass and those of other teleost, avian, reptiles, amphibian and mammalian species. We then used real time RT-PCR technology to monitor for the first time in sea bass, dynamic changes in mRNA copy number of Hb-LP, HLP1, HLP2, and dicentracin in gills, skin, eyes, stomach and proximal intestine in response to acute crowding/confinement stress. We showed that acute crowding stress induces an increase in the expression levels of the aforementioned genes, in gills and skin of sea bass, but not in other tissues, and that this expression patterns are not always rapidly reversed upon re-exposure to normal conditions.

CONCLUSION: The higher expression of the four target genes in gills and skin of sea bass suggests that this AMPP represents a first and immediate line of defense in combating pathogens and stressors since these tissues constitute the first physiological barriers of the animal.},

abstract = {Fish is considered to be an important model in comparative immunology studies because it is a representative population of lower vertebrates serving as an essential link to early vertebrate evolution. Fish immune-relevant genes have received considerable attention due to its role in improving understanding of both fish immunology and the evolution of immune systems. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of teleost immune-relevant genes for both innate and adaptive immunity, including pattern recognition receptors, antimicrobial peptides, complement molecules, lectins, interferons and signaling factors, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adaptive immunity relevant cytokines and negative regulators, major histocompatibility complexes, immunoglobulins, and costimulatory molecules. The implications of these factors on the evolutionary history of immune systems were discussed and a perspective outline of innate and adaptive immunity of teleost fish was described. This review may provide clues on the evolution of the essential defense system in vertebrates.},

abstract = {alpha-Defensins are mediators of mammalian innate immunity, and knowledge of their structure-function relationships is essential for understanding their mechanisms of action. We report here the NMR solution structures of the mouse Paneth cell alpha-defensin cryptdin-4 (Crp4) and a mutant (E15D)-Crp4 peptide, in which a conserved Glu(15) residue was replaced by Asp. Structural analysis of the two peptides confirms the involvement of this Glu in a conserved salt bridge that is removed in the mutant because of the shortened side chain. Despite disruption of this structural feature, the peptide variant retains a well defined native fold because of a rearrangement of side chains, which result in compensating favorable interactions. Furthermore, salt bridge-deficient Crp4 mutants were tested for bactericidal effects and resistance to proteolytic degradation, and all of the variants had similar bactericidal activities and stability to proteolysis. These findings support the conclusion that the function of the conserved salt bridge in Crp4 is not linked to bactericidal activity or proteolytic stability of the mature peptide.},

abstract = {Cytokines, produced at the site of entry of a pathogen, drive inflammatory signals that regulate the capacity of resident and newly arrived phagocytes to destroy the invading pathogen. They also regulate antigen presenting cells (APCs), and their migration to lymph nodes to initiate the adaptive immune response. When naive CD4+ T cells recognize a foreign antigen-derived peptide presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex class II on APCs, they undergo massive proliferation and differentiation into at least four different T-helper (Th) cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, and induced T-regulatory (iTreg) cells in mammals. Each cell subset expresses a unique set of signature cytokines. The profile and magnitude of cytokines produced in response to invasion of a foreign organism or to other danger signals by activated CD4+ T cells themselves, and/or other cell types during the course of differentiation, define to a large extent whether subsequent immune responses will have beneficial or detrimental effects to the host. The major players of the cytokine network of adaptive immunity in fish are described in this review with a focus on the salmonid cytokine network. We highlight the molecular, and increasing cellular, evidence for the existence of T-helper cells in fish. Whether these cells will match exactly to the mammalian paradigm remains to be seen, but the early evidence suggests that there will be many similarities to known subsets. Alternative or additional Th populations may also exist in fish, perhaps influenced by the types of pathogen encountered by a particular species and/or fish group. These Th cells are crucial for eliciting disease resistance post-vaccination, and hopefully will help resolve some of the difficulties in producing efficacious vaccines to certain fish diseases.},

Despite extensive taxonomic studies, for a variety of reasons the identification of fishes can be problematic, even for experts. DNA barcoding is proving to be a useful tool in this context. However, its broad application is impeded by the need to construct a comprehensive reference sequence library for all fish species. Here, we make a regional contribution to this grand challenge by calibrating the species discrimination efficiency of barcoding among 125 Argentine fish species, representing nearly one third of the known fauna, and examine the utility of these data to address several key taxonomic uncertainties pertaining to species in this region.},

abstract = {This historic review describes the people that were involved in studying some aspect of fish immunology and vaccination from as early as 1854. Between 1850 and 1940, most scientists were looking at fish from the angle of comparative anatomy, embryology, physiology, taxonomy and fish diseases. Most publications from this early period are describing the morphology of blood cells and hemopoietic or lymphoid organs. The first publications on specific immune responses and vaccination of fish were found in the period 1935-1938. However, the immune mechanisms behind protective immunization were largely unknown in those days. In the period after 1940, the first researchers can be found devoting their whole career to fish immunology. This paper has been organized largely by individuals and not so much by accomplishments. It is not the intent of this review to evaluate the scientific merit of the work discussed, but to provide the reader with information that was - at least in part - lost to the scientific community. Publications from before 1940 or in languages other than English (e.g. Russian) are usually not found by today's database searches on the Internet.},

abstract = {Immunomodulatory feed additives are expected to exert their primary influence at the intestinal level through the expression of cytokines, which in turn affect the immune responses in fish. In two separate experiments a yeast-derived mannan oligosaccharide product (YM) or a purified $\beta$-glucan (BG) product were fed to Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) for 5 weeks, after which they were bath-challenged with a bacterial pathogen--Vibrio anguillarum. The transcription of selected cytokines (proinflammatory--il1b, il8, ifng; anti-inflammatory--il10) in different intestinal segments was analysed using qPCR. In the case of YM study, the effect of the compound was observed in both the posterior intestine and rectum of Atlantic cod, upon challenge with the pathogen. iIl1b expression in the posterior intestine and rectum of post-challenge fish was significantly higher than that of pre-challenge fish. In the case of il8 the difference was confined to rectum. The expression of ifng was altered only in the anterior intestine upon YM feeding. In the BG trial, the additive had a differential effect on the expression of the cytokine genes. In anterior intestine and rectum, the purified $\beta$-glucan additive significantly elevated the expression of il1b when challenged with V. anguillarum. An effect of BG on the anti-inflammatory cytokine il10 was visible in the rectum after the pathogen challenge. The differential responses of cytokines in the intestine of fish upon exposure to V. anguillarum suggest that both mannan oligosaccharides and $\beta$-glucans impact the ability of Atlantic cod to respond to the pathogen.},

Two samples were selected for these analyses based on differences detected in the overall levels of microbial diversity between them. Richness estimators indicate that TRFLP analysis significantly underestimates the richness of the relatively high-diversity seafloor basalt microbial community: at least 50\% of species from the high-diversity site are missed by TRFLP. However, both methods reveal similar dominant species from the samples, and they predict similar levels of relative diversity between the two samples. Importantly, these results suggest that DNA-extraction or PCR-related bias between the two laboratories is minimal. We conclude that TRFLP may be useful for relative comparisons of diversity between basalt samples, for identifying dominant species, and for estimating the richness and evenness of low-diversity, skewed populations of seafloor basalt microbial communities, but that TRFLP may miss a majority of species in relatively highly diverse samples.},

The effects of AFB1, glucan and their interactions on non-specific and specific immunity levels and disease resistance of fish were studied. A single intraperitoneal injection of AFB1 at 1.25 mg kg(-1) body weight) caused a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in non-specific immunity as measured through neutrophil phagocytic indices, serum bactericidal activity, and specific immunity as measured through bacterial agglutination titre against Edwardsiella tarda, as well as reduced protection against Aeromonas hydrophila challenge in comparison to control fish which were exposed neither to aflatoxin nor to glucan. Feeding of glucan to healthy fish raised the non-specific and specific immunity level and protection against bacterial infection compared with the control. Feeding of glucan to AFB1-induced immunocompromised fish for 7 days significantly raised the degree of resistance against A. hydrophila challenge and the non-specific immunity level in comparison to non-treated AFB1 exposed fish. Although feeding of glucan was able to increase specific immunity, all measured through haemagglutination titre against sheep red blood cells, and bacterial (E. tarda) agglutination titre in healthy fish in comparison to all other groups, no significant increase in specific immunity to the aflatoxin-exposed group was seen.},

abstract = {The present work evaluates the effects of inulin and Bacillus subtilis, single or combined, on immune parameters, immune-related gene expression and protection against Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). Three trials were conducted. In the first trial, different concentrations of inulin (10, 15 and 30 g kg(-1)) (as a prebiotic) were administered to determine the optimal concentration for stimulating the seabream's immune system. In the second trial, the optimum concentration of inulin (10 g kg(-1)) was combined with B. subtilis (as a probiotic). Following two and four weeks of the treatment, the main immune parameters, as well as the expression of seven immune-related genes, were measured. In the final trial, fish fed the same diet as in the second trial were challenged intraperitoneally with P. damselae subsp. piscicida (10(9) cfu g(-1)). Treatment groups for the second and third trial were control (non-supplemented diet), inulin (10 g kg(-1)), B. subtilis (10(7) cfu g(-1)) and inulin + B. subtilis (10 g kg(-1) and 10(7) cfu g(-1) respectively). Dietary administration of inulin or B. subtilis for two weeks stimulated the serum complement activity and the IgM level, as well as leucocyte phagocytic activity; furthermore, inulin stimulated leucocyte respiratory burst activity. When inulin and B. subtilis were administered together (as a synbiotic), only the serum complement activity and the IgM level increased in a statistically significant manner. Furthermore, the complement activity showed a significant increase in fish fed the three experimental diets for four weeks. The challenge experiment showed that the fish fed inulin or the synbiotic diet had non-significantly lower or significantly higher cumulative mortality, respectively, compared with the control group (non-supplemented diet). These results suggest that inulin and B. subtilis modulate the immune response of the gilthead seabream, although the combined administration increases susceptibility to infection by P. damselae subsp. piscicida.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate different molecular tools based on the 16S rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer, and the rpoB gene to examine the bacterial populations present in juvenile rainbow trout intestines. DNA was extracted from both pooled intestinal samples and bacterial strains. Genes were PCR-amplified and analysed using both temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. Because of the high cultivability of the samples, representative bacterial strains were retrieved and we compared the profiles obtained from isolated bacteria with the profile of total bacteria from intestinal contents. Direct analysis based on rpoB-TTGE revealed a simple bacterial composition with two to four bands per sample, while the 16S rRNA gene-TTGE showed multiple bands and comigration for a few species. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene- and rpoB-TTGE bands revealed that the intestinal microbiota was dominated by Lactococcus lactis, Citrobacter gillenii, Kluyvera intermedia, Obesumbacterium proteus, and Shewanella marinus. In contrast to 16S rRNA gene-TTGE, rpoB-TTGE profiles derived from bacterial strains produced one band per species. Because the single-copy state of rpoB leads to a single band in TTGE, the rpoB gene is a promising molecular marker for investigating the bacterial community of the rainbow trout intestinal microbiota.},

Although some components of this system are constitutively expressed, new evidence reviewed in this Progress article shows that the production of certain antimicrobial proteins by epithelial cells can also be regulated by cytokines of the innate and adaptive immune systems. In particular, the effector cytokines interleukin-17 and interleukin-22, which are produced by the T-helper-17-cell subset, are emerging as crucial regulators of antimicrobial-peptide production in the gut and the lungs. This suggests that this T-cell lineage and its cytokines have important roles in skin and mucosal immunity.},

The infection of fish resulted in a strong inhibition of the respiratory burst, in contrast with the slight increase in respiratory burst of leukocytes from fish injected with dead bacteria. In addition, we observed a concomitant down-regulation of p22(phox) and p40(phox), two components of the NADPH oxidase, in the leukocytes from infected fish. To investigate whether these differences may be the result of a dysregulation of cytokines expression in infected fish, we cloned several sea bass cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and three CC chemokines, and performed a detailed expression study with these and other cytokines. Surprisingly, cytokine expression was fairly similar in leukocytes from both live and formalin-killed V. anguillarum-challenged fish, the response being even higher and longer lasting in infected fish. Furthermore, the expression of two key apoptotic caspases, caspase-3 and -9, was down-regulated in leukocytes from infected fish, but remained unaltered in fish injected with formalin-killed bacteria. These results suggest that the virulence mechanisms of V. anguillarum in sea bass involve the inhibition of leukocyte respiratory burst and apoptosis, and thereby providing a safe haven for growth.},

abstract = {Teleost fish NCCs (nonspecific cytotoxic cells) are thought to be the evolutionary precursors of the mammalian NK cells. A novel mechanism mediating the NCC-mediated cytotoxicity has been described in teleosts. Now, this NCC receptor protein-1 (NCCRP-1) was characterized in gilthead seabream. The NCCRP-1 full-length sequence contains 1036 bp with an open reading frame of 702 bp. A comparison of the predicted 233-amino acid protein with several fish orthologues indicates a highly conserved sequence containing the F-box associated (FBA) domain and proline-rich motifs (PRM) characteristics of this family. The phylogenetical tree shows that seabream NCCRP-1 belongs to the NCCRP subfamily within the FBA family of proteins. This is a single copy gene with a constitutive and ubiquitous expression as determined by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. The results show that lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages and acidophilic granulocytes from lymphoid tissues express the receptor, both at gene and protein level. Immunofluorescence microscopic observations confirm the previous results. The implications of this receptor on seabream NCC activity are discussed.},

All cathelicidin family members are synthesized and stored in cells as two-domain proteins. These are split on demand to produce a cathelin protein and an antimicrobial peptide. Accumulating evidence indicates that both the cathelin portion and the C-terminal peptide exert biological activities connected with host protection. This review presents an overview of the structure and biology of cathelicidins and discusses recent progress in cathelicidin research with emphasis on the functional properties and role in host defense of the human cathelicidin hCAP18/LL-37. Although investigators initially concentrated their attention on antibiotic activity, it is becoming clear now that LL-37 is a multifunctional molecule that may mediate various host responses, and thus represents an essential component of the innate immune system in humans.},

abstract = {Rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mikiss) possess two genes encoding putative leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins similar to human TLR5. Molecular cloning of these two LRR proteins suggested the presence of a TLR5-like membrane form (rtTLR5M) and a soluble form (rtTLR5S). Here we elucidated the primary structures and the unique combinational functions of these fish versions of TLR5. The LRR regions of rtTLR5S and rtTLR5M exhibited 81\% homology and relatively high (35.6 and 33.7\%) homology to the extracellular domains of human TLR5 (huTLR5). Thus, two distinct genes encode the TLR5 orthologs in fish, one of which has a consensus intracellular domain (TIR). In order to test their functions, we constructed fusion proteins with the LRR region of rtTLR5S (S-chimera) or that of rtTLR5M and the TIR of huTLR5 (M-chimera). The S- and M-chimeras expressed in HeLa or CHO cells signaled the presence of Vibrio anguillarum flagellin, resulting in NF-kappaB activation. rtTLR5M was ubiquitously expressed, whereas rtTLR5S was predominantly expressed in the liver. In the hepatoma cell lines of the rainbow trout RTH-149, stimulation of rtTLR5M with V. anguillarum or its flagellin allowed the up-regulation of rtTLR5S. Flagellin-mediated NF-kappaB activation was more significant in the presence of or simultaneous expression of rtTLR5S. Therefore, a two-step flagellin response occurred for host defense against bacterial infection in fish: (a) flagellin first induced basal activation of NF-kappaB via membrane TLR5, facilitating the production of soluble TLR5 and minimal acute phase proteins, and (b) the inducible soluble TLR5 amplifies membrane TLR5-mediated cellular responses in a positive feedback fashion.},

Like other organisms, fish secrete different kinds of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are positively charged short amino-acid-chain molecules involved in host defense mechanisms. Environmental hazards and the greenhouse effect have led to increased evolution of drug- and vaccine-resistant pathogenic strains, and it is necessary to find new drugs with structural uniqueness to fight them. Aquatic sources contain thousands of fish species, and each secretes AMPs with structural differences which can be used by the pharmaceutical industry in its search for novel drugs to treat drug-resistant pathogens. Not only limited to antimicrobial functions, AMPs possess other desirable characteristics which may be exploited in the near future. In this review, we list fish AMPs available from published reports, and discuss application-oriented functions of these AMPs. Notably, the possibilities of using fish AMPs as antimicrobial agents, vaccine adjuvants, inactivated vaccines, and antitumor agents are discussed in this review.},

abstract = {Gastrointestinal infections involve an interactive tripartite relationship between the invading pathogen, the host, and the host's resident intestinal microbiota. To characterize the host inflammatory response and microbiota alterations during enteric salmonellosis, C57BL/6 mice were pre-treated with a low dose of streptomycin (LD model) and then infected with S. typhimurium strains, including mutants in the two Type III secretion systems, SPI-1 and SPI-2 (invAmut and ssaRmut, respectively). Cecal colonization and inflammation in the LD model were evaluated to assess infection success and progression, and compared to the traditional high dose (HD) model. Perturbations to the microbial community in the LD model were assessed via evaluation of total microbial numbers, the proportion of intestinal $\gamma$-Proteobacteria and tRFLP analysis. In the LD model, consistently high colonization by the parental strain (WT) and invAmut S. typhimurium was associated with significant intestinal pathology. However, microbial community profiles were more similar both in numbers and composition between mice infected with the mutant strains, than with the WT strain. Consequently, significant infection-induced inflammation did not always produce similar microbiota perturbations. Large numbers of luminal neutrophils were observed in the ceca of WT-infected, but not in invAmut or ssaRmut infected mice. Neutrophils were thus implicated as a potential mediator of microbiota perturbations during WT enteric salmonellosis. These studies offer a new model of S. typhimurium-induced intestinal disease that retains the three participants of the disease process and further defines the role of virulence factors, the host microbiota, and inflammation in S. typhimurium-induced intestinal disease.},

In recent years much attention has been given to the identification of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in fish, however, characterisation of interactions with specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is still incomplete. Microarray studies have significantly contributed to functional studies and early descriptions of PAMP-PRR driven activation of specific response cassettes in the genome have been obtained although much is left to be done. In this review we will address gram negative (G-negative) bacterial recognition in fish addressing contributing factors such as structure-function relationships between G-negative PAMPs, current knowledge of fish PRRs and the input achieved by microarray-based studies ranging from in vivo infection studies to directed in vitro PAMP-cell studies. Finally we revisit the endotoxic recognition paradigm in fish and suggest a series of future perspectives that could contribute toward the further elucidation of G-negative bacterial recognition across the highly diverse group of vertebrates that encompass the fishes.},

In unfertilised eggs, transcripts encoding lysozyme and cathelicidin were found indicating maternal transfer of antibacterial transcripts. Lysozyme activity was also present at this stage suggesting the presence of a functional protein. Transcripts of two other putative antibacterial genes (hepcidin and pentraxin) and antiviral genes (ISG15 and LGP2) were absent in unfertilised eggs. The transcriptional onset of these genes occurred during the gastrula period. Transcripts of the heavy chain constant regions of the immunoglobulin (Ig) D, membrane-associated and secreted form of IgM were absent in unfertilised eggs. Transcription of the heavy chain locus commenced at low levels during the segmentation period indicating the onset of B-cell development. Most innate immune genes showed an increase in transcription around hatch and first feeding, indicating a preparation for increased pathogen exposure at this time. Prior to and during metamorphosis all genes showed a pronounced elevation in transcript levels indicating a further maturation of the immune system during this period.},

It is in many cases the only method for measuring mRNA levels of vivo low copy number targets of interest for which alternative assays either do not exist or lack the required sensitivity. Benefits of this procedure over conventional methods for measuring RNA include its sensitivity, large dynamic range, the potential for high throughout as well as accurate quantification. To achieve this, however, appropriate normalisation strategies are required to control for experimental error introduced during the multistage process required to extract and process the RNA. There are many strategies that can be chosen; these include normalisation to sample size, total RNA and the popular practice of measuring an internal reference or housekeeping gene. However, these methods are frequently applied without appropriate validation.

abstract = {Fibroblasts have shown to be an immune competent cell type in mammals. However, little is known about the immunological functions of this cell-type in lower vertebrates. A rainbow trout hypodermal fibroblast cell-line (RTHDF) was shown to be responsive to PAMPs and DAMPs after stimulation with LPS from E. coli, supernatant and debris from sonicated RTHDF cells. LPS was overall the strongest inducer of IL-1beta, IL-8, IL-10, TLR-3 and TLR-9. IL-1beta and IL-8 were already highly up regulated after 1 hour of LPS stimulation. Supernatant stimuli significantly increased the expression of IL-1beta, TLR-3 and TLR-9, whereas the debris stimuli only increased expression of IL-1beta. Consequently, an in vivo experiment was further set up. By mechanically damaging the muscle tissue of rainbow trout, it was shown that fibroblasts in the muscle tissue of rainbow trout contribute to electing a highly local inflammatory response following tissue injury. The damaged muscle tissue showed a strong increase in the expression of the immune genes IL-1beta, IL-8 and TGF-beta already 4 hours post injury at the site of injury while the expression in non-damaged muscle tissue was not influenced. A weaker, but significant response was also seen for TLR-9 and TLR-22. Rainbow trout fibroblasts were found to be highly immune competent with a significant ability to express cytokines and immune receptors. Thus fish fibroblasts are believed to contribute significantly to local inflammatory reactions in concert with the traditional immune cells.},

abstract = {Eradication of infectious disease is our global health challenge. After encountering intestinal infection with a bacterial pathogen, the host defense program is initiated by local antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that eliminate invading pathogens by phagocytosis and establish localized inflammation by secreting cytokines and chemokines. These pathogen-experienced APCs migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes, where host immune responses are precisely orchestrated. Initiation and regulation of this defense program appear to be largely dependent on innate immunity which is antigen non-specific and provides a rapid defense against broader targets. On the other hand, many bacterial enteropathogens have evoked abilities to modify the host defense program to their advantage. Therefore, better understanding of the host-pathogen interactions is essential to establish effective eradication strategies for enteric infectious diseases. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of innate immune regulation of the host defense mechanisms against intestinal infection by bacterial pathogens.},

abstract = {Fish macrophage function can be altered after exposure to pathogens as well as to xenobiotics. Considering that wild and farmed fish can be exposed in their habitats simultaneously to different types of stressors, including chemical contaminants (e.g. heavy metals) and pathogens (e.g. bacteria), it is fundamental to study their impact either isolated or in combination. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of copper and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), alone and in combination, on the transcription of target genes related with immune system, respiratory burst activity and cell death, using rainbow trout macrophages as in vitro model. A cell viability experiment was performed to determine the sub-lethal concentrations of copper for rainbow trout macrophages and the LC50-24 h was estimated at 60 $\mu$M. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$) increased after copper and copper plus LPS exposure. Copper and LPS interact positively inducing an increase in cytokine expression, which may be indicative of an increased inflammatory response. However, the increase in TNF$\alpha$ mRNA expression induced by 50 $\mu$M copper was not accompanied by protein secretion indicating that mRNA abundance does not always reflect the level of protein and that the translation of the TNF$\alpha$ mRNA is somehow inhibited. Serum amyloid A (SAA) and trout C-polysaccharide binding protein (TCPBP) mRNA expression also increased after copper, LPS or LPS plus copper exposure, indicating a role of acute phase proteins in the local response to inflammation. NADPH oxidase and glutathione peroxidase gene expression increased in macrophages after 24 h exposure to copper, LPS or LPS plus copper. The results from the present study improve the understanding of mechanisms involved in copper toxicity, as well as the interaction with a simulated-inflammatory process.},

abstract = {The production of fish larvae is often hampered by high mortality rates, and it is believed that most of this economic loss due to infectious diseases is ca. 10\% in Western European aquaculture sector. The development of strategies to control the pathogen load and immuno-prophylactic measures must be addressed further to realise the economic "potential" production of marine fish larvae and thus improve the overall production of adult fish. The innate defence includes both humoral and cellular defence mechanisms such as the complement system and the processes played by granulocytes and macrophages. A set of different substances such as beta-glucans, bacterial products, and plant constituents may directly initiate activation of the innate defence mechanisms acting on receptors and triggering intracellular gene activation that may result in production of anti-microbial molecules. These immunostimulants are often obtained from bacterial sources, brown or red algae and terrestrial fungi are also exploited as source of novel potentiating substances. The use of immunostimulants, as dietary supplements, can improve the innate defence of animals providing resistance to pathogens during periods of high stress, such as grading, reproduction, sea transfer and vaccination. The immunomodulation of larval fish has been proposed as a potential method for improving larval survival by increasing the innate responses of the developing animals until its adaptive immune response is sufficiently developed to mount an effective response to the pathogen. To this end it has been proposed that the delivery of immunostimulants as a dietary supplement to larval fish could be of considerable benefit in boosting the animals innate defences with little detriment to the developing animal. Conversely, there is a school of thought that raises the concern of immunomodulating a neotanous animal before its immune system is fully formed as this may adversely affect the development of a normal immune response.},

It is involved in the pathogenesis and control of infectious diseases, tumors, autoimmune processes and chronic degenerative diseases. Because of its variety of reaction partners (DNA, proteins, low-molecular weight thiols, prosthetic groups, reactive oxygen intermediates), its widespread production (by three different NO synthases (NOS) and the fact that its activity is strongly influenced by its concentration, NO continues to surprise and perplex immunologists. Today, there is no simple, uniform picture of the function of NO in the immune system. Protective and toxic effects of NO are frequently seen in parallel. Its striking inter- and intracellular signaling capacity makes it extremely difficult to predict the effect of NOS inhibitors and NO donors, which still hampers therapeutic applications.},

abstract = {We have isolated and characterized cDNAs and genes for pufferfish, Fugu rubripes, (Fugu) orthologues of mammalian interleukin (IL)-12 subunits (IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p40). The deduced amino acid sequences of the Fugu IL-12 subunits showed homology with mammalian IL-12 subunits (p35: 50.4-58.0\% similarity; p40: 51.2-55.4\% similarity). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that Fugu IL-12 p35 and p40 genes cluster with their mammalian counterpart lineages. The genomic organization of each of the Fugu IL-12 subunit genes is similar to that of the corresponding mouse IL-12 subunit genes, although the Fugu genes are very compact due to small intron size. Comparative genomic analysis showed conserved syntenies within the IL-12 p35 and p40 regions between Fugu and human, indicating that the Fugu IL-12 p35 and p40 genes are orthologues for mammalian IL-12 p35 and p40 encoding genes, respectively. Expression of IL-12 p35 mRNA was observed in lymphoid tissues and several non-lymphoid tissues, while expression of IL-12 p40 mRNA was constitutive and nearly ubiquitous. In the spleen and head kidney, expression of IL-12 p35 was induced by polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] and not by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while expression of IL-12 p40 was constitutive and unresponsive to both poly(I:C) and LPS. These results indicate that IL-12 levels are regulated by production of IL-12 p35 mRNA and suggest that IL-12 in fish may be involved in antiviral defense. This is the first report of the identification and characterization of IL-12 subunit cDNAs and genes in a non-mammalian vertebrate.},

abstract = {Nonspecific cytotoxic cells (NCC) obtained from the head (anterior) kidney of fish (Ictalurus punctatus) lyse human transformed B-cell targets. Lysis depended on direct cell-cell contact. Fish size, age, environmental holding temperatures, and lytic reaction conditions such as osmolality and optimum effector:target cell ratios were optimized. Experiments to characterize optimum kinetics demonstrated highly efficient killing after two hours incubation. This rapid cytolysis was further studied by determining NCC activity against appropriately labeled target cells after 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes of cocultivation. At 160:1 (E:T) greater than 40\% of the 5 hour percent specific release value was produced after 30 minutes. After 90 minutes, more than 90\% of total percent specific release was observed. At least one mechanism of regulation of NCC killing was described. In the presence of normal (homologous or heterologous) catfish serum (CFS), essentially no NCC activity was observed. This suppression was reversible by preincubation in 10\% fetal bovine serum (FBS). NCC "activation" by preincubation in 10\% FBS was time-dependent (at least four hours was required to generate significant lysis). NCC activation could be reversed by treating potentially lytic cells with supernatants containing dissociated CFS. In addition, reversible activation could be demonstrated by treating potentially lytic effector cells with CFS to produce suppression. Regulation occurred at the effector cell level because treated target cells did not suppress NCC activity. These data demonstrate a population of nonspecific effector cytolytic cells that potentially represent a phylogenetic precursor to mammalian natural killer cells.},

abstract = {The commensal microbiota protects the murine host from enteric pathogens. Nevertheless, specific pathogens are able to colonize the intestinal tract and invade, despite the presence of an intact biota. Possibly, effective pathogens disrupt the indigenous microbiota, either directly through pathogen-commensal interaction, indirectly via the host mucosal immune response to the pathogen, or by a combination of these factors. This study investigates the effect of peroral Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection on the intestinal microbiota. Since the majority of the intestinal microbiota cannot be cultured by conventional techniques, molecular approaches using 16S rRNA sequences were applied. Several major bacterial groups were assayed using quantitative PCR. Administration of either the 50\% lethal dose (LD(50)) or 10x LD(50) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium caused changes in the microbiota throughout the intestinal tract over the time course of infection. A 95\% decrease in total bacterial number was noted in the cecum and large intestine with 10x LD(50) S. enterica serovar Typhimurium challenge at 7 days postinfection, concurrent with gross evidence of diarrhea. In addition, alterations in microbiota composition preceded the onset of diarrhea, suggesting the involvement of pathogen-commensal interactions and/or host responses unrelated to diarrhea. Microbiota alterations were not permanent and reverted to the microbiota of uninfected mice by 1 month postinfection. Infection with a Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) mutant did not result in microbiota alterations, while SPI2 mutant infections triggered partial changes. Neither mutant was capable of prolonged colonization or induction of mucosal inflammation. These data suggest that several Salmonella virulence factors, particularly those involved in the local mucosal host response, are required for disruption of the intestinal ecosystem.},

abstract = {The field of mucosal immunology research has grown fast over the past few years, and our understanding on how mucosal surfaces respond to complex antigenic cocktails is expanding tremendously. With the advent of new molecular sequencing techniques, it is easier to understand how the immune system of vertebrates is, to a great extent, orchestrated by the complex microbial communities that live in symbiosis with their hosts. The commensal microbiota is now seen as the "extended self" by many scientists. Similarly, fish immunologist are devoting important research efforts to the field of mucosal immunity and commensals. Recent breakthroughs on our understanding of mucosal immune responses in teleost fish open up the potential of teleosts as animal research models for the study of human mucosal diseases. Additionally, this new knowledge places immunologists in a better position to specifically target the fish mucosal immune system while rationally designing mucosal vaccines and other immunotherapies. In this review, an updated view on how teleost skin, gills and gut immune cells and molecules, function in response to pathogens and commensals is provided. Finally, some of the future avenues that the field of fish mucosal immunity may follow in the next years are highlighted.},

The increased RMR corresponded to elevated levels of serum lysozyme activity and an earlier seroconversion of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies. To determine if growth performance was affected by the transient increase in RMR, specific growth rate (SGR), percent daily weight gain (WG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were determined at 798, 1204, and 1610 dd pvi. Although fish in all three vaccine groups showed significant increases in SGR and WG at 798 and 1610 dd pvi compared to the control group, the overall weight of the fish was not different at the end of the experiment. In summary, this study shows that concurrent injection of a DV and an AV transiently increases the RMR of rainbow trout and changes the manner in which the immune response occurs, but does not affect the overall growth performance of the fish.},

C3, alpha2M, SAA and C1/MASP2 mRNA were produced by embryos from 12 h post-fertilisation, which is relatively long before hatching (2 days post-fertilisation (dpf)), indicating either involvement of these factors in development itself or more probably a preparation of the immune system for the post-hatching period. In addition, maternal mRNA of the aforementioned innate immune factors and maternal C3- and immunoglobulin protein was present in unfertilised eggs. Furthermore, C3 mRNA production was situated in the yolk syncytial layer in embryos from 24 h post-fertilisation to 5 dpf, followed by the liver in larvae, providing a new sequence of C3 production in teleost development.},

abstract = {A method to culture tissue explants of the intestine from freshwater-adapted sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) was developed to assess possible direct effects of cortisol on Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity. As judged by several criteria, explants from pyloric ceca and the posterior region of the intestine remained viable during short-term (6-day) culture, although Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity declined and basolateral components of the enterocytes were observed to be partially degraded. Addition of cortisol to the culture medium maintained Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity (over 2-12 days) above that of control explants and, in some cases, was similar to levels before culture. The response to cortisol was dose dependent (0.001-10 microg/ml). Within the physiological range, the response was specific for cortisol and showed the following hierarchy: dexamethasone >/= cortisol > 11-deoxycortisol > cortisone. Insulin maintained Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity over controls in explants of ceca but not posterior intestine. To compare in vivo and in vitro responses, slow-release implants of cortisol (50 microg/g) were administered to salmon for 7 days. This treatment elevated plasma cortisol levels and stimulated Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in both intestinal regions. The results demonstrate that the teleost intestine is a direct target of cortisol, this corticosteroid protects in vitro functionality of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, and explants retain cortisol responsiveness during short-term culture.},

abstract = {The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary beta-1, 3 glucan on the innate immune response and protection against Vibrio harveyi infection in large yellow croaker, Pseudosciaena crocea. A basal diet was supplemented with 0\% (control), 0.09\% (low) and 0.18\% (high) beta-1, 3 glucan to formulate three experimental diets. Each diet was randomly allocated to triplicate groups of fish in floating sea cages (1.5 x 1.5 x 2.0m), and each cage was stocked with 100 fish (initial average weight 9.75+/-0.35 g). Fish were fed twice daily (05:00 and 17:00) to apparent satiation for 8 weeks. The results of 8 weeks feeding trial showed that low glucan supplementation (0.09\%) significantly enhanced fish growth, whereas high supplementation (0.18\%) did not. The serum lysozyme activity was significantly increased with the increase of dietary glucan (P < 0.05), and fish fed the diet with high glucan had significantly higher lysozyme activity compared with low glucan. There were no significant differences in alternative complement pathway (ACP) activity between fish fed diets with and without supplementation of glucan. The phagocytosis percentage (PP) and respiratory burst activity in fish fed the diet with 0.09\% glucan were significantly higher than those in fish fed with the control diet (P < 0.05), but both immunological parameters significantly decreased in fish fed the diet with high supplementation compared with low supplementation and no significant difference was observed between the control and high supplementation groups. The challenge experiment showed that fish fed the diet with low glucan had significantly lower cumulative mortality compared with the control and high glucan groups (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was observed between the control and high supplementation groups. These results suggested that low glucan could enhance growth and innate immunity of large yellow croaker with an 8-week oral administration, but higher supplementation did not influence growth, or further improve immunity of large yellow croaker.},

abstract = {A lambda clone containing a rainbow trout IL-1beta1 gene was isolated by a PCR screening strategy from a genomic library cloned in lambda GEM-11, and an EcoRI fragment from this clone was fully sequenced, and contained 1680 bp 5'-flanking sequence, the whole IL-1beta1 gene open reading frame, and the 3'-flanking region with two potential poly A signals and poly A sites. This clone encoded a protein that shared 99.8\% identity to the previously published trout IL-1beta1 cDNA sequence, with only three base substitutions. The main difference was that this clone had an additional complete HpaI SINE insertion in the 3rd intron making intron III 211 bp larger (834 bp via 623 bp). Thus this sequence was designated as allele B (Big intron III) of IL-1beta1 and the previously reported sequence as allele S (Short intron III). Three lines of evidence (allele specific PCR, cloning and sequencing, and direct sequencing of PCR products) revealed that allele B was constitutively expressed and could respond to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or trout recombinant IL-1beta. Searching of the GenBank database with the HpaI SINE sequence resulted in three additional HpaI loci being identified in rainbow trout. Another SINE retroposition was also identified in the same intron of both alleles of IL-1beta1 by comparison with the trout IL-1beta2 gene. This novel SINE sequence, sharing high homology with the HpaI SINE at the 3'-end region, is present in EST databases of several species including human, mouse and fish. The consensus of this novel SINE shares 57 to 61\% identities to tRNA-Leu from different species. Another older retroposition event in the same intron of IL-1beta1 has also been hypothesised, recognised as six adenines, that may function as a RNA polIII terminator. A model for the IL-1beta1 allele formation is proposed. Following the earliest retroposition into one of the two IL-1beta genes that resulted from a genome duplication in salmonids, the proper environment for successive PV SINE retroposition was created. A recent retroposition of the HpaI SINE in IL-1beta1 resulted in the formation of the two alleles of IL-1beta1. Examination of the SINEs insertion and their host gene microenvironments revealed that the SINE retroposition does not appear random, both in the site selection and the direction of insertion. The mechanism governing this outcome is discussed.},

The peptides are broad spectrum microbicides in vitro and numerous $\theta$-defensin isoforms have been identified in granulocytes of rhesus macaques and Olive baboons. Several mammalian $\alpha$- and $\beta$-defensins, genetically related to $\theta$-defensins, have proinflammatory and immune-activating properties that bridge innate and acquired immunity. In the current study we analyzed the immunoregulatory properties of rhesus $\theta$-defensins 1-5 (RTDs 1-5). RTD-1, the most abundant $\theta$-defensin in macaques, reduced the levels of TNF, IL-1$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, and IL-8 secreted by blood leukocytes stimulated by several TLR agonists. RTDs 1-5 suppressed levels of soluble TNF released by bacteria- or LPS-stimulated blood leukocytes and THP-1 monocytes. Despite their highly conserved conformation and amino acid sequences, the anti-TNF activities of RTDs 1-5 varied by as much as 10-fold. Systemically administered RTD-1 was non-toxic for BALB/c mice, and escalating intravenous doses were well tolerated and non-immunogenic in adult chimpanzees. The peptide was highly stable in serum and plasma. Single dose administration of RTD-1 at 5 mg/kg significantly improved survival of BALB/c mice with E. coli peritonitis and cecal ligation-and-puncture induced polymicrobial sepsis. Peptide treatment reduced serum levels of several inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in bacteremic animals. Collectively, these results indicate that the anti-inflammatory properties of $\theta$-defensins in vitro and in vivo are mediated by the suppression of numerous proinflammatory cytokines and blockade of TNF release may be a primary effect.},

Intestinal fluid chemistry revealed early onset of drinking and slightly delayed intestinal water absorption that coincided with initiation of NaCl absorption and HCO(3)(-) secretion. Suggestive of involvement in osmoregulation, relative mRNA levels for vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3), Na(+)-HCO(3)(-) cotransporter 1, and two carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms [a general cytosolic isoform trout cytoplasmic CA (tCAc) and an extracellular isoform trout membrane-bound CA type IV (tCAIV)], were increased transiently in the intestine following exposure to 65\% seawater. Both tCAc and tCAIV proteins were localized to apical regions of the intestinal epithelium and exhibited elevated enzymatic activity after acclimation to 65\% seawater. The V-ATPase was localized to both basolateral and apical regions and exhibited a 10-fold increase in enzymatic activity in fish acclimated to 65\% seawater, suggesting a role in marine osmoregulation. The intestinal epithelium of rainbow trout acclimated to 65\% seawater appears to be capable of both basolateral and apical H(+) extrusion, likely depending on osmoregulatory status and intestinal fluid chemistry.},

abstract = {Salt-bridge interactions between acidic and basic amino acids contribute to the structural stability of proteins and to protein-protein interactions. A conserved salt-bridge is a canonical feature of the $\alpha$-defensin antimicrobial peptide family, but the role of this common structural element has not been fully elucidated. We have investigated mouse Paneth cell $\alpha$-defensincryptdin-4 (Crp4) and peptide variants with mutations at Arg7 or Glu15 residue positions to disrupt the salt-bridge and assess the consequences on Crp4 structure, function, and stability. NMR analyses showed that both (R7G)-Crp4 and (E15G)-Crp4 adopt native-like structures, evidence of fold plasticity that allows peptides to reshuffle side chains and stabilize the structure in the absence of the salt-bridge. In contrast, introduction of a large hydrophobic side chain at position 15, as in (E15L)-Crp4 cannot be accommodated in the context of the Crp4 primary structure. Regardless of which side of the salt-bridge was mutated, salt-bridge variants retained bactericidal peptide activity with differential microbicidal effects against certain bacterial cell targets, confirming that the salt-bridge does not determine bactericidal activity per se. The increased structural flexibility induced by salt-bridge disruption enhanced peptide sensitivity to proteolysis. Although sensitivity to proteolysis by MMP7 was unaffected by most Arg(7) and Glu(150 substitutions, every salt-bridge variant was degraded extensively by trypsin. Moreover, the salt-bridge facilitates adoption of the characteristic $\alpha$-defensin fold as shown by the impaired in vitro refolding of (E15D)-proCrp4, the most conservative salt-bridge disrupting replacement. In Crp4, therefore, the canonical $\alpha$-defensin salt-bridge facilitates adoption of the characteristic $\alpha$-defensin fold, which decreases structural flexibility and confers resistance todegradation by proteinases.},

abstract = {Cationic and amphiphilic peptides are widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms and constitute a first line of host defense against invading pathogens. Some of these host defense peptides (HDPs) combine specific antibiotic activities with modulation of immune responses. Moreover, they are active against bacteria resistant to conventional antibiotics and show only modest resistance development under in vitro selection pressure. Based on these features, HDPs and particularly defensins are considered a promising source of novel anti-infective agents. This review summarizes the current knowledge about defensins from different kingdoms and discusses their potential for therapeutic application.},

abstract = {Host defense against microbes requires the development of an efficient immune response aimed to eradicate the source of infection. Through the expression of a battery of germ-line encoded receptors, including the Toll-like receptors and Nod proteins, the innate immune system, which is a prerequisite to the adaptive immune response, detects microbial motifs and initiates pro-inflammatory signaling. Current research into innate immune function focuses on the nature of the ligands detected by this system, the cell signaling that occurs downstream of receptor activation and finally, how these signals culminate into a tailored adaptive immune response directed to eradicate a specific infection.},

abstract = {Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been used in the present work to study the fish response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure and LPS tolerance. These mechanisms are not completely understood in mammals and, presently, are totally unknown in fish. Zebrafish larval survival was assessed following treatment with various types of LPS at a variety of concentrations to determine the sensitivity of zebrafish to LPS-induced immune activation. In addition, fish pretreated with a sublethal concentration of LPS did not die after exposure to a lethal concentration of LPS demonstrating, for the first time that LPS tolerance also happens in fish. The time interval between pretreatment and secondary exposure as well as the type of pretreatment dictated the strength of protection. Since zebrafish are in intimate contact with microorganisms, the high resistance of fish to LPS suggests that there must be a tight control of the LPS receptor cluster in order to avoid an excess of inflammation. One of these components is CXCR4, which has previously been shown to regulate the signal transduced by TLR4. Treating fish with AMD3100, a specific inhibitor of CXCR4, increased LPS treatment associated mortality. Blocking CXCR4 via chemical or genetic inhibition resulted in a reversion of LPS tolerance, thus further supporting the negative regulatory role of CXCR4 in this inflammatory response. In support of an inhibitory role for CXCR4 in the inflammatory cascade, IL-1 transcript levels were elevated in both unstimulated and LPS stimulated zebrafish Odysseus (CXCR4 deficient mutant) larvae.},

abstract = {Cathelicidins are a family of antimicrobial peptides prominent in the host defense mechanisms of several mammalian species. In addition to their antimicrobial activities, these peptides have been implicated in wound healing, angiogenesis, and other innate immune mechanisms. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of cathelicidin gene expression, we conducted in vitro experiments evaluating the bone marrow cell expression of two porcine cathelicidins, PR-39 and protegrin, and cloned and evaluated the promoter sequence of PR-39. In addition, we evaluated in vivo kinetics of cathelicidin gene expression in pigs during an infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased PR-39 and protegrin mRNA expression, which was ameliorated by polymyxin B. Concentrations of PR-39 in supernatants from bone marrow cell cultures were increased 10-fold after LPS stimulation. Similarly, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and all-trans retinoic acid (RA) markedly induced cathelicidin gene expression. To verify the transcriptional activation of the PR-39 gene by these agents, we made a PR-39 promoter-luciferase construct containing the full-length PR-39 promoter driving luciferase gene expression and transiently transfected PK-15 epithelial cells. RA and IL-6 increased luciferase activity in PK-15 cells transfected with the PR-39 promoter-luciferase reporter. Similarly, Salmonella-challenged pigs showed increased expression of PR-39 and protegrin mRNA in bone marrow cells at 6 and 24 h postchallenge. Taken together, these findings show that bacterial products (LPS), IL-6, RA, and Salmonella infection enhance the expression of the cathelicidins, PR-39 and protegrin, in bone marrow progenitor cells, and we suggest that extrinsic modulation of this innate host defense mechanism may be possible.},

abstract = {An initial bioinformatics investigation followed by cloning and sequencing analysis, has led to the identification of three novel members (omDB-2, omDB-3, omBD-4) of the beta-defensin family in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The contiguous sequences could be translated to give predicted peptides of 62 (omDB-2), 63 (omDB-3) and 68 (omDB-4) amino acids (aa) in length, with mature peptides of 43 (omDB-2), 39 (omDB-3) and 42 (omDB-4) aa, with no obvious proregion present. Analysis of the gene organization found that all three new genes contained three exons divided by two introns, as seen in defensin genes of other fish species. Constitutive expression of all the trout defensins was detected by RT-PCR in a wide range of mucosal and systemic tissues from healthy fish, with omDB-3 and omDB-4 showing the highest expression levels. Following bacterial challenge in vivo, the defensin genes were induced at the three mucosal sites examined (skin, gill, gut), with levels of omDB-2 and omDB-3 increased some 16-fold in gut and gill respectively. Using polyinosinic polycytosinic RNA (polyI:C) as a viral mimic, all of the four trout beta-defensin genes were induced in head kidney primary leucocyte cultures at 4h post-stimulation, with omDB-1 and omDB-3 particularly highly expressed. These data suggest that beta-defensins are likely an important component of the innate defences of fish, and reveal an added level of antimicrobial peptide complexity in fish to that known previously.},

abstract = {The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary chitooligosaccharides (COS) supplementation on the innate immune response and protection against Vibrio harveyi infection in Trachinotus ovatus. A basal diet was supplemented with 0.0 (control), 2.0, 4.0 and 6.0 g COS kg(-1) to formulate four experimental diets. Each diet was randomly allocated to triplicate groups of ﬁsh in ﬂoating sea cages (1.5 × 1.0 × 2.0 m), and each cage was stocked with 80 ﬁsh (initial average weight 10.8 ± 0.05 g). After 8 weeks of feeding trial, Both the final weight and specific growth rate (SGR) signiﬁcantly increased with increasing dietary COS levels up to 4.0 g kg(-1), whereas there were no signiﬁcant differences for COS levels from 4.0 to 6.0 g kg(-1). A decreased feed conversion ratio (FCR) was observed with increasing dietary COS levels. The total leukocyte counts (WBC), differential leukocyte counts, respiratory burst activity, lysozyme and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were signiﬁcantly increased with the increased levels of dietary COS (P < 0.05), and reached a maximum at level of 4.0 g kg(-1) COS. There were no signiﬁcant differences in those immunological parameters between 4.0 and 6.0 g kg(-1) COS. Moreover, the dietary COS supplementation groups also exhibited a decrease in the cumulative symptom rates compared to the controls when challenged with V. harveyi. These results indicated that dietary intake containing COS could enhance the immune responses of fish and improve its resistance to infection by V. harveyi. Especially supplementation with 4.0 g kg(-1) COS to the fish for 56 days showed considerable improvement in the growth, survival and immune response of the fish.},

abstract = {Further to the previous finding of the rainbow trout rtCATH\_1 gene, this paper describes three more cathelicidin genes found in salmonids: two in Atlantic salmon, named asCATH\_1 and asCATH\_2, and one in rainbow trout, named rtCATH\_2. All the three new salmonid cathelicidin genes share the common characteristics of mammalian cathelicidin genes, such as consisting of four exons and possessing a highly conserved preproregion and four invariant cysteines clustered in the C-terminal region of the cathelin-like domain. The asCATH\_1 gene is homologous to the rainbow trout rtCATH\_1 gene, in that it possesses three repeat motifs of TGGGGGTGGC in exon IV and two cysteine residues in the predicted mature peptide, while the asCATH\_2 gene and rtCATH\_2 gene are homologues of each other, with 96\% nucleotide identity. Salmonid cathelicidins possess the same elastase-sensitive residue, threonine, as hagfish cathelicidins and the rabbit CAP18 molecule. The cleavage site of the four salmonid cathelicidins is within a conserved amino acid motif of QKIRTRR, which is at the beginning of the sequence encoded by exon IV. Two 36-residue peptides corresponding to the core part of rtCATH\_1 and rtCATH\_2 were chemically synthesized and shown to exhibit potent antimicrobial activity. rtCATH\_2 was expressed constitutively in gill, head kidney, intestine, skin and spleen, while the expression of rtCATH\_1 was inducible in gill, head kidney, and spleen after bacterial challenge. Four cathelicidin genes have now been characterized in salmonids and two were identified in hagfish, confirming that cathelicidin genes evolved early and are likely present in all vertebrates.},

These animal models are useful for studying coevolved relationships between host and microbiota only if the microbial communities that occur in animals in lab facilities are representative of those that occur in nature. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequence-based comparisons of gut bacterial communities in zebrafish collected recently from their natural habitat and those reared for generations in lab facilities in different geographic locations. Patterns of gut microbiota structure in domesticated zebrafish varied across different lab facilities in correlation with historical connections between those facilities. However, gut microbiota membership in domesticated and recently caught zebrafish was strikingly similar, with a shared core gut microbiota. The zebrafish intestinal habitat therefore selects for specific bacterial taxa despite radical differences in host provenance and domestication status.},

abstract = {The complement system plays key roles in innate and adaptive immunity through mediating phagocytosis, chemotaxis and cell lysis. Complement component C3 is a central component in the complement cascade and belongs to the acute-phase proteins whose synthesis increase immediately upon inflammatory stimuli. The liver is the main producer of C3 and it is a well-known fact that the mammalian monocyte-macrophage lineage is a major contributor to extrahepatic C3. Immunomodulators, such as LPS and beta-glucan, can stimulate complement, lysozyme, natural killer cells and antibody responses in fish, thus enhancing the resistance to bacterial pathogens and parasitic infections. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of LPS and beta-glucan on the expression of interleukins (IL-1beta1, IL-1beta2 and IL-6) and the modulated expression of C3 subtypes (C3-1, C3-3 and C3-4) in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using real-time RT-PCR. From in vitro studies, we demonstrated that head kidney macrophages from rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon showed no basal transcription of C3. After immunostimulation, the cells responded by increased levels of ILs, but transcription of C3 was not induced. In contrast to the in vitro findings, the rainbow trout complement C3 subtypes were differentially regulated 48 h after in vivo stimulation with LPS and beta-glucan. These results support the previous findings of absence of C3 in macrophages of the spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor) and is the first functional study showing differential regulation of the C3 subtypes in any vertebrate.},

Those isolated from some mammalian and insect species, although not evolutionarily related, use a similar mechanism to selectively kill Gram-negative bacteria, with a low toxicity to animals. Unlike other types of antimicrobial peptides, their mode of action does not involve the lysis of bacterial membranes but entails penetration into susceptible cells, where they then act intracellularly. Some aspects of the transport system and cytoplasmic targets have been elucidated. These features make them attractive both as anti-infective lead compounds and as a new class of potential cell-penetrating peptides capable of internalising membrane-impermeant drugs into both bacterial and eukaryotic cells.},

A comprehensive understanding of these host-microbe interactions requires appreciation of the developmental context into which a microbe is introduced, as well as the effects of that microbial challenge on host ontogeny. In this review, we discuss how in vivo imaging and genetic analysis in zebrafish has advanced our knowledge of host-microbe interactions in the context of a developing vertebrate host. We focus on recent insights into immune cell ontogeny and function, commensal microbial relationships in the intestine, and microbial pathogenesis in zebrafish hosts.},

abstract = {Gene in the interleukin 1 family plays a central role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. Here, we describe two novel IL-1-like gene in Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus (jfIL1-L1 and jfIL1-L2). jfIL1$\beta$-L1 was homologous to Nile Tilapia IL-1$\beta$-like gene and Arctic char IL-1, and jfIL1$\beta$-L2 showed homology to hypothetical protein LOC100699119 of Nile Tilapia and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss IL-1 receptor agonist (RA). The deduced amino acids sequences of these IL-1$\beta$-like genes showed very low identities to the Japanese flounder IL-1 (jfIL-1). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that jfIL1$\beta$-L1 and -L2 were distinct from jfIL-1. The gene encoding the predicted ORF of jfIL1$\beta$-L1 and -L2 is divided into 6 exons and 7 exons, respectively. Transcripts of jfIL1$\beta$-L1 were detected in gills, intestine, kidney and spleen, and those of jfIL1$\beta$-L2 were detected in gills, intestine and spleen. The mRNA levels of jfIL1$\beta$-L1 and -L2 were not effect or slightly decreased by treatment with LPS and the formalin-killed cells of Edwardsiella tarda whilst mRNA levels of jfIL1$\beta$ were significantly increased in the kidney and spleen at 6 h by these treatments.},

abstract = {Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are a family of antioxidant proteins also involved in inflammation and innate immunity. Prx1 and Prx2 are also known as natural killer enhancing factor (NKEF)-A and NKEF-B, respectively, by their ability to prime the mammalian NK-cells activity. In teleost fish, NKEF genes have been isolated but their regulation has been scarcely evaluated. We have identified orthologues of the NKEF-A and NKEF-B genes in the teleost European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) which showed constitutive expression and wide distribution in their tissues. In vitro, the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass NKEFs were slightly up-regulated in head-kidney leucocytes after stimulation with unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, poly I:C or pathogenic bacteria. In vivo, seabream and sea bass infection with nodavirus up-regulated the expression of NKEF genes in the brain (target tissue for nodavirus) and head-kidney at different infection times. Although further studies are necessary to ascertain their role as antioxidant proteins and in the immune response in teleost fish, our results suggest a primary role of seabream and sea bass NKEFs in the innate immune response against bacterial and viral agents.},

abstract = {Chemokines are chemoattractant cytokines defined by the presence of four conserved cysteine residues which in mammals can be divided into four subfamilies depending on the arrangement of the first two conserved cysteines in their sequence: CXC ($\alpha$), CC ($\beta$), C and CX(3)C classes. Evolutionarily, fish can be considered as an intermediate step between species which possess only innate immunity (invertebrates) and species with a fully developed acquired immune network such as mammals. Therefore, the functionality of their different immune cell types and molecules is sometimes also intermediate between innate and acquired responses. The first chemokine gene identified in a teleost was a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) chemokine designated as CK1 in 1998. Since then, many different chemokine genes have been identified in several fish species, but their role in homeostasis and immune response remains largely unknown. Extensive genomic duplication events and the fact that chemokines evolve more quickly than other immune genes, make it very difficult to establish true orthologues between fish and mammalian chemokines that would help us with the ascription of immune roles. In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge of chemokine biology in teleost fish, focusing mainly on which genes have been identified so far and highlighting the most important aspects of their expression regulation, due to the great lack of functional information available for them. As the number of chemokine genes begins to close down for some teleost species, there is an important need for functional assays that may elucidate the role of each of these molecules within the fish immune response.},

abstract = {The innate immune system is the only defence weapon of invertebrates and a fundamental defence mechanism of fish. The innate system also plays an instructive role in the acquired immune response and homeostasis and is therefore equally important in higher vertebrates. The innate system's recognition of non-self and danger signals is served by a limited number of germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors/proteins, which recognise pathogen associated molecular patterns like bacterial and fungal glycoproteins and lipopolysaccharides and intracellular components released through injury or infection. The innate immune system is divided into physical barriers, cellular and humoral components. Humoral parameters include growth inhibitors, various lytic enzymes and components of the complement pathways, agglutinins and precipitins (opsonins, primarily lectins), natural antibodies, cytokines, chemokines and antibacterial peptides. Several external and internal factors can influence the activity of innate immune parameters. Temperature changes, handling and crowding stress can have suppressive effects on innate parameters, whereas several food additives and immunostimulants can enhance different innate factors. There is limited data available about the ontogenic development of the innate immunological system in fish. Active phagocytes, complement components and enzyme activity, like lysozyme and cathepsins, are present early in the development, before or soon after hatching.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine if multiple injections of different dosages of beta-glucan derived from barley would enhance the immune response and disease resistance against infections due to opportunistic pathogens Aeromonas hydrophila and Edwardsiella tarda in Labeo rohita fingerlings. Hence, four different dosages of beta-glucan suspension in phosphate-buffered saline at the rate of 0, 5, 10, 15 mg kg(-1) body weight of fish were injected intraperitoneally to the fingerlings of Labeo rohita at two-week intervals for four times. After every two-week interval different serum biochemical, haematological and immunological parameters of fish were evaluated. At the end of immunostimulation trial of 56 days, fish were divided into four subgroups under each major treatment group for challenge through i.p injection and bath immersion with two pathogens, A. hydrophila and E. tarda. The mortality (\%) and agglutinating antibody titre was recoded on 28th day post challenge. Most of the immune parameters such as leucocyte count, phagocytic ratio, phagocytic index, lysozyme activity, complement activity, serum bactericidal activity were significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced on 42 days after three i.p injections of 10 mg of beta-glucan kg(-1) body wt. Challenge study indicated least mortality in the group of fishes injected with medium dose of 10 mg of beta-glucan kg(-1) body wt. four times. Multiple injections of beta-glucan might have maintained the activation of phagocytic cells for a long period which in turn would lead to long-term protection in fishes. Thus, injections of 10 mg of beta-glucan kg(-1) body wt. for three times can be advocated to enhance the immune response of fish species under aquaculture.},

Many other members of this family have been identified since the first cathelicidin sequences were reported 10 years ago. The mature peptides generally show a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity and, more recently, some of them have also been found to exert other biological activities. The human cathelicidin peptide LL-37 is chemotactic for neutrophils, monocytes, mast cells, and T cells; induces degranulation of mast cells; alters transcriptional responses in macrophages; stimulates wound vascularization and re-epithelialization of healing skin. The porcine PR-39 has also been involved in a variety of processes, including promotion of wound repair, induction of angiogenesis, neutrophils chemotaxis, and inhibition of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase activity, whereas the bovine BMAP-28 induces apoptosis in transformed cell lines and activated lymphocytes and may thus help with clearance of unwanted cells at inflammation sites. These multiple actions provide evidence for active participation of cathelicidin peptides in the regulation of the antimicrobial host defenses.},

One area of interest is the development of new immune adjuvants. Immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides containing the CpG motif (CpG ODN) can induce production of a wide variety of cytokines and activate B cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and NK cells. Using the 38C13 B cell lymphoma model, we assessed whether CpG ODN can function as immune adjuvants in tumor antigen immunization. The idiotype served as the tumor antigen. Select CpG ODN were as effective as complete Freund's adjuvant at inducing an antigen-specific antibody response but were associated with less toxicity. These CpG ODN induced a higher titer of antigen-specific IgG2a than did complete Freund's adjuvant, suggesting an enhanced TH1 response. Mice immunized with CpG ODN as an adjuvant were protected from tumor challenge to a degree similar to that seen in mice immunized with complete Freund's adjuvant. We conclude that CpG ODN are effective as immune adjuvants and are attractive as part of a tumor immunization strategy.},

Thus, we have studied the inulin effects on the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.) innate immune response both in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro study, head-kidney leucocytes were incubated with inulin (ranging from 0 to 1000 microg ml(-1)) for 30, 90, 180 and 300 min and 24h and any effect was observed on leucocyte viability or the main innate cellular immune responses (leucocyte peroxidase, phagocytic, respiratory burst and natural cytotoxic activities). For the in vivo study, seabream specimens were fed for 1 or 2 weeks with a commercial diet supplemented with inulin: 0 (control), 5 or 10 g inulin kg(-1) diet (0.5 and 1\%, respectively). Inulin produced a significant inhibition in phagocytosis and respiratory burst in leucocytes from specimens fed diets containing 0.5\% or 1\% of inulin for 1 week. Based on the present results, inulin does not seem to be a good immunostimulant for seabream, though its effects in other species and combined with other immunostimulans (i.e. probiotics) might be of great interest.},

abstract = {Cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides are abundant in animal and plant tissues involved in host defense. In insects, most are synthesized in the fat body, an organ analogous to the liver of vertebrates. From human urine, we characterized a cysteine-rich peptide with three forms differing by amino-terminal truncation, and we named it hepcidin (Hepc) because of its origin in the liver and its antimicrobial properties. Two predominant forms, Hepc20 and Hepc25, contained 20 and 25 amino acid residues with all 8 cysteines connected by intramolecular disulfide bonds. Reverse translation and search of the data bases found homologous liver cDNAs in species from fish to human and a corresponding human genomic sequence on human chromosome 19. The full cDNA by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends was 0.4 kilobase pair, in agreement with hepcidin mRNA size on Northern blots. The liver was the predominant site of mRNA expression. The encoded prepropeptide contains 84 amino acids, but only the 20-25-amino acid processed forms were found in urine. Hepcidins exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus niger and antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and group B Streptococcus. Hepcidin may be a vertebrate counterpart of cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides produced in the fat body of insects.},

abstract = {Interleukine-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$) is the most studied pro-inflammatory cytokine, playing a central role in the generation of systemic and local responses to infection, injury, and immunological challenges. In mammals, IL-1$\beta$ is synthesized as an inactive 31 kDa precursor that is cleaved by caspase-1 generating a 17.5 kDa secreted active mature form. The caspase-1 cleavage site strictly conserved in all mammalian IL-1$\beta$ sequences is absent in IL-1$\beta$ sequences reported for non-mammalian vertebrates. Recently, fish caspase-1 orthologues have been identified in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and sea bream (Sparus aurata) but very little is known regarding their processing and activity. In this work it is shown that sea bass caspase-1 auto-processing is similar to that of the human enzyme, resulting in active p24/p10 and p20/p10 heterodimers. Moreover, the presence of alternatively spliced variants of caspase-1 in sea bass is reported. The existence of caspase-1 isoforms in fish and in mammals suggests that they have been evolutionarily maintained and therefore are likely to play a regulatory role in the inflammatory response, as shown for other caspases. Finally, it is shown that sea bass and avian IL-1$\beta$ are specifically cleaved by caspase-1 at different but phylogenetically conserved aspartates, distinct from the cleavage site of mammalian IL-1$\beta$.},

abstract = {Stimulatory effects of yeast beta-1,3-1,6-glucans on neutrophils have long been recognized, but effects of glucans on degranulation of primary granules in fish neutrophils have not been previously reported. Neutrophil function was monitored during in vitro and in vivo application of glucans to non- (NS), acute- (AS) and chronically stressed (CS) fish. beta-Glucan proved to be a strong and quick (80\%, 2 min) stimulant of degranulation. Dietary glucan increased degranulation in NS fish, and prevented a decrease in AS fish. Degranulation in CS fish returned to NS levels 3 days after the glucan diet was fed. Fathead minnows appear to be a useful model to investigate neutrophil degranulation in fish exposed to different environmental conditions and immunomodulators. Use of beta-glucans in fish diets prior to AS and during chronic stress can enhance neutrophil function, potentially increasing disease resistance and survival rates after transportation or exposure to poor water quality.},

abstract = {Although there are a variety of methods available for the detection of Renibacterium salmoninarum, the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease in salmon and trout, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is probably the most widely used method. However, ELISA measures bacterial antigen, which does not necessarily reflect the number of cells present. We hypothesized that dual analysis of kidney tissue by ELISA and a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (qPCR) would provide complementary information about antigen level and the number of bacterial genomes. We found that DNA extracted from the insoluble fraction of the ELISA tissue preparation produced the same qPCR result as DNA extracted directly from frozen tissue, permitting true dual analysis of the same tissue sample. We examined kidney tissue in this manner from individual free-ranging juvenile Chinook salmon and antibiotic-treated captive subadult Chinook salmon and observed 3 different patterns of results. Among the majority of fish, there was a strong correlation between the ELISA value and the qPCR value. However, subsets of fish exhibited either low ELISA values with elevated qPCR values or higher ELISA values with very low qPCR values. These observations suggest a conceptual model that allows inferences about the state of infection of individual fish based on dual ELISA/qPCR results. Although this model requires further assessment through experimental infections and treatments, it may have utility in broodstock selection programs that currently apply egg-culling practices based on ELISA alone.},

Discriminant analyses indicated that several morphospecies of Ceratomyxa coexist in these hosts, despite the fact that the specific level of taxonomic resolution of each spore was not attempted. At least 4 species, i.e., Ceratomyxa hokarari Meglitsch, 1960; Ceratomyxa inversa Meglitsch, 1960; Ceratomyxa laxa Meglitsch, 1960; and Ceratomyxa elongata Meglitsch, 1960 occur in the study area, and at least 2 species co-occur in each host and geographical location. The most widespread pattern found is that spores are larger in golden ling (Genypterus blacodes) and spore size decreases with increasing latitude; this may be associated with the species composition of these assemblages, as well as with the habitat and diet segregation of the host species.},

abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates hematopoiesis, inflammation, immune responses and bone homeostasis in mammals. Fish IL-6 has been cloned in recent years but to date no functional studies have been reported. Thus, in this paper we present for the first time in fish the functional characterisation of IL-6, using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as the fish model and with a focus on macrophage effects. Trout IL-6 (tIL-6) expression in macrophages could be induced by proinflammatory agents (LPS, polyI:C, and IL-1$\beta$) and recombinant tIL-6 (rtIL-6) rapidly induced STAT3 phosphorylation and expression of SOCS-1 to -3, CISH and IRF-1, as seen in mammals. However, three findings in this study suggest a novel role of tIL-6 in fish. Firstly, macrophage growth was enhanced by rtIL-6 in vitro, suggesting that IL-6 produced during inflammatory events may promote macrophage proliferation locally. Secondly, rtIL-6 induced the expression of cathelicidin-2, an antimicrobial peptide with immune-modulatory function, but down-regulated the expression of IL-1$\beta$ and TNF-$\alpha$, indicating a role of IL-6 in host defence and also in limiting inflammation. Thirdly, rtIL-6 induced the expression of hepcidin in macrophages. In mammals hepcidin is antimicrobial but also regulates iron homeostasis by inhibiting iron absorption, and its expression is induced by IL-6 only in hepatocytes but not macrophages. Thus, in fish if IL-6 is induced in patrolling macrophages during sepsis this may act to reduce iron availability by induction of hepcidin expression and lead to iron deficiency, as a means to limit the spread of infection.},

abstract = {Production of antimicrobial peptides and proteins is an important means of host defense in eukaryotes. The larger antimicrobial proteins, containing more than 100 amino acids, are often lytic enzymes, nutrient-binding proteins or contain sites that target specific microbial macromolecules. The smaller antimicrobial peptides act largely by disrupting the structure or function of microbial cell membranes. Hundreds of antimicrobial peptides have been found in the epithelial layers, phagocytic cells and body fluids of multicellular animals, from mollusks to humans. Some antimicrobial peptides are produced constitutively, others are induced in response to infection or inflammation. Studies of the regulation of antimicrobial peptide synthesis in Drosophila have been particularly fruitful, and have provided a new paradigm for the analysis of mammalian host defense responses. It now appears that the general patterns of antimicrobial responses of invertebrates have been preserved in vertebrates ("innate immunity") where they contribute to host defense both independently and in complex interplay with adaptive immunity.},

All these factors have negative impacts on fish well-being and overall performance, with consequent economic losses. Though good management practices contribute to reduce stressor effects, stress susceptibility is always high under crowded conditions. Adequate nutrition is essential to avoid deficiency signs, maintain adequate animal performance and sustain normal health. Further, it is becoming evident that diets overfortified with specific nutrients [amino acids, essential fatty acids (FAs), vitamins or minerals] at levels above requirement may improve health condition and disease resistance. Diet supplements are also being evaluated for their antioxidant potential, as fish are potentially at risk of peroxidative attack because of the large quantities of highly unsaturated FAs in both fish tissues and diets. Functional constituents other than essential nutrients (such as probiotics, prebiotics and immunostimulants) are also currently being considered in fish nutrition aiming to improve fish growth and/or feed efficiency, health status, stress tolerance and resistance to diseases. Such products are becoming more and more important for reducing antibiotic utilization in aquafarms, as these have environmental impacts, may accumulate in animal tissues and increase bacterial resistance. This study reviews knowledge of the effect of diet nutrients on health, welfare and improvement of disease resistance in fish.},

abstract = {Fish eggs are released and embryos hatch into a pathogenically hostile environment, at a time when their immunological capacity is severely limited. Although the eggs are initially protected by the envelope as well as by several innate and adaptive immune substances, which are transferred to eggs during fish vitellogenesis, it seems that young specimens depend fundamentally on their innate defence mechanisms. Here we show in the gilthead seabream, an immunologically tractable teleost fish model, that the first lymphocyte marker genes, those coding for the two subunits for the recombination activating gene, were detected by RT-PCR around 21-27 days post-hatching (dph). In addition, the transcripts coding for the alpha and beta subunits of the T-cell receptor and the light and heavy chains of immunoglobulin M were detected at 27-48 dph. However, most innate immune genes analyzed were already expressed at hatching, including those coding for the toll-like receptors, pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules, antiviral and antibacterial factors, and phagocyte markers. Using the information from the gene expression study, we also examined the achievement of immunocompetence by analyzing the protection induced by a bacterin against the pathogenic bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida. The results show that vaccination of young larvae of this species by either immersion or oral routes resulted in increased susceptibility to infection of the specimens, and point to the lack of correlation between the achievement of immunocompetence and detection of the adaptive immunity markers.},

abstract = {The neuroprotective effects of oestrogens have been demonstrated against a variety of insults, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and cerebral ischemia under certain conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying oestrogen neuroprotection are still unclear. We aimed to determine whether 17beta-oestradiol (E(2)) administration post-hypoxia (p-hx) was neuroprotective and whether these actions were mediated through oestrogen receptors (ER). For this purpose, 12-embyonic day-old chickens were subjected to acute hypoxia [8\% (O(2)), 60 min], followed by different reoxygenation periods. To test the neuroprotective effect of E(2) and its mechanism, embryos were injected 30 min after the end of hypoxia with E(2) alone or with ICI 182 780, a competitive antagonist of ER. Cytochrome c (cyt c) release, an indicator of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, was measured by western blot in optic lobe cytosolic extracts. DNA fragmentation by TUNEL fluorescence and caspase-3 fragmentation by immunofluorescence were detected on optic lobe sections. Acute hypoxia produces a significant increase in cyt c release from mitochondria at 4 h p-hx, followed by an increase in TUNEL positive cells 2 h later (6 h p-hx). Administration of E(2) (0.5 mg/egg) produced a significant decrease in cytosolic cyt c levels at 4 h p-hx, in caspase-3 activation and in TUNEL positive cells at 6 h p-hx compared to vehicle treated embryos. In the E(2)-ICI 182 780 treated embryos, cyt c release, caspase-3 fragmentation and TUNEL positive cells were similar to the hypoxic embryos, thus suggesting the requirement of an E(2)-ER interaction for E(2) mediated neuroprotective effects. In conclusion, E(2) prevents hypoxia-induced cyt c release and posterior cell death and these effects are mediated by oestrogen receptors.},

abstract = {The mammalian interleukins IL-1beta and IL-8 are important pro-inflammatory cytokines often used as markers of an activated inflammatory response, while IL-10 is regarded as an anti-inflammatory cytokine and plays a crucial role in the regulation of inflammation. Few cytokines from gadoid fish have been described, and herein the sequence and expression of these interleukin genes are studied in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.). IL-1beta, IL-8 and IL-10 from cod show similarities in gene organisation and predicted protein sequences, compared to counterpart genes in other teleosts. Gene expression was studied using quantitative real time PCR in response to several treatments both in vitro and in vivo. In adherent head kidney cells, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly stimulated gene expression of IL-1beta. The expression of IL-1beta was not increased after treatment with a viral imitator (poly I:C), and neither IL-8 nor IL-10 responded to any of these agents in vitro. However, in vivo administrated poly I:C and formalin-killed Vibrio anguillarum (In-V.ang) induced interleukin expression, varying in intensity between different organs. IL-1beta and IL-10 gene expression profiles showed an opposite induction pattern in the in vivo experiments. Injection of In-V.ang highly induced IL-1beta expression, while a low induction was evident for IL-10, whereas the opposite was observed after injection of poly I:C. This pattern was particularly marked in spleen, where also IL-8 followed the expression pattern of IL-1beta. The opposite expression profiles indicate a suppressive role for IL-10 on the transcription of IL-1beta, and to a lesser extent on IL-8 transcription. Along with the identification of important promoter regulatory motives, these results provide tools for studying inflammatory responses in cod.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two decades after the introduction of oil-based vaccines in the control of bacterial and viral diseases in farmed salmonids, the mechanisms of induced side effects manifested as intra-abdominal granulomas remain unresolved. Side effects have been associated with generation of auto-antibodies and autoimmunity but the underlying profile of inflammatory and immune response has not been characterized. This study was undertaken with the aim to elucidate the inflammatory and immune mechanisms of granuloma formation at gene expression level associated with high and low side effect (granuloma) indices.Groups of Atlantic salmon parr were injected intraperitoneally with oil-adjuvanted vaccines containing either high or low concentrations of Aeromonas salmonicida or Moritella viscosa antigens in order to induce polarized (severe and mild) granulomatous reactions. The established granulomatous reactions were confirmed by gross and histological methods at 3 months post vaccination when responses were known to have matured. The corresponding gene expression patterns in the head kidneys were profiled using salmonid cDNA microarrays followed by validation by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). qPCR was also used to examine the expression of additional genes known to be important in the adaptive immune response.

RESULTS: Granulomatous lesions were observed in all vaccinated fish. The presence of severe granulomas was associated with a profile of up-regulation of innate immunity-related genes such as complement factors C1q and C6, mannose binding protein, lysozyme C, C-type lectin receptor, CD209, Cathepsin D, CD63, LECT-2, CC chemokine and metallothionein. In addition, TGF-beta (p = 0.001), IL-17A (p = 0.007) and its receptor (IL-17AR) (p = 0.009) representing TH17 were significantly up-regulated in the group with severe granulomas as were arginase and IgM. None of the genes directly reflective of T(H)1 T cell lineage (IFN-gamma, CD4) or T(H)2 (GATA-3) responses were differentially expressed.

CONCLUSIONS: Granulomatous reactions following vaccination with oil-based vaccines in Atlantic salmon have the profile of strong expression of genes related to innate immune responses. The expression of TGF-beta, IL-17A and its receptor suggests an involvement of T(H)17 T cell lineage and is in conformity with strong infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into inflamed areas. Arginase upregulation shows that macrophages in these reactions are alternatively activated, indicating also a T(H)2-profile. To what extent the expression of IL-17A and its receptor reflects an autoimmune vaccine-based reaction remains elusive but would be in conformity with previous observations of autoimmune reactions in salmon when vaccinated with oil-based vaccines.},

abstract = {The present experiment was carried out to study the effect of different dosages of beta-glucan suspension derived from barley on the innate immune response and disease resistance of Anabas testudineus spawns against infection caused by Aeromonas hydrophila. Four different dosages of beta-glucan suspension in phosphate buffered saline at the rate of 0, 5, 10, 15 mg l(-1) were taken and 8 days old spawn were exposed for 2 h and 3 h. The cell suspension of spawn was assayed for total protein, acid phosphatase activity, lysozyme activity, bactericidal and NBT. Further, the spawns were challenged with 3 x 10(5) cells ml(-1) of A. hydrophila and survivability percentage and immunological parameters were assayed upto day 7. On day 7, most of the immunological parameters such as lysozyme activity, bactericidal activity and NBT activity were significantly enhanced after exposing the fish to all the concentrations of beta-glucan. Challenge study indicated least mortality in the group of spawns immersed in 15 mg l(-1) beta-glucan suspension for 3 h. Thus, 3 h exposure to beta-glucan suspension could reduce the mortality and increase the immunity of A. testudineus spawns.},

abstract = {Interleukin-8 has long been recognized to have anti-inflammatory activity, which has been established in various models of infection, inflammation, and cancer. Several cell types express the receptor for the cytokine IL-8 and upon its recognition produce molecules that are active both locally and systemically. Many different types of cells, in particular monocytes, neutrophils, epithelial, fibroblast, endothelial, mesothelial, and tumor cells, secrete IL-8. Increased expression of IL-8 and/or its receptors has been characterized in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including psoriasis, ARDS, COPD, and RA as well as many cancers, and its upregulation often correlates with disease activity. IL-8 constitutes the CXC class of chemokines, a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils and other immune cells. It is a proangiogenic cytokine that is overexpressed in many human cancers. Therefore, inhibiting the effects of IL-8 signaling may be a significant therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {The synergetic effects of multiple rhodopsin mutations on color tuning need to be completely elucidated. Systematic genetic studies and spectroscopy have demonstrated an interesting example of synergetic color tuning between two amino acid residues in conger rhodopsin's ancestral pigment (p501): -a double mutation at one nearby and one distant residue led to a significant $\lambda$(max) blue shift of 13 nm, whereas neither of the single mutations at these two sites led to meaningful shifts.To analyze the molecular mechanisms of this synergetic color tuning, we performed homology modeling, molecular simulations, and electronic state calculations. For the double mutant, N195A/A292S, in silico mutation analysis demonstrated conspicuous structural changes in the retinal chromophore, whereas that of the single mutant, A292S, was almost unchanged. Using statistical ensembles of QM/MM optimized structures, the excitation energy of retinal chromophore was evaluated for the three visual pigments. As a result, the $\lambda$(max) shift of double mutant (DM) from p501 was -8 nm, while that of single mutant (SM) from p501 was +1 nm. Molecular dynamics simulation for DM demonstrated frequent isomerization between 6-s-cis and 6-s-trans conformers. Unexpectedly, however, the two conformers exhibited almost identical excitation energy, whereas principal component analysis (PCA) identified the retinal-counterion cooperative change of BLA (bond length alternation) and retinal-counterion interaction lead to the shift.},

abstract = {We analysed the effect of probiotic strains on the cellular and humoral immune responses of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and their capacity to prevent furunculosis during a challenge trial. Probiotic strains (Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis CLFP 100, Leuconostoc mesenteroides CLFP 196, and Lactobacillus sakei CLFP 202) were administered orally to fish for 2 weeks at 10(6) CFU g(-1) of feed. In comparison to untreated control fish, the phagocytic activity of head kidney leukocytes and the alternative complement activity in serum were significantly greater in all probiotic groups at the end of the second week. With the exception of the group fed with Lactobacillus sakei, superoxide anion production was also significantly increased in the probiotic groups. Analysis of lysozyme activity did not exhibit any significant difference in the probiotic and control groups. Fifteen days after the start of the probiotic feeding, fish were challenged with Aeromonas salmonicida ssp. salmonicida. The fish supplemented with probiotics exhibited survival rates ranging from 97.8\% to 100\%, whereas survival was 65.6\% in fish not treated with the probiotics. These results demonstrate that probiotic supplementation to fish can reduce the severity of furunculosis, and suggest that this reduction may be associated with enhanced humoral and cellular immune response.},

In addition, the internal organs (kidney, liver, and spleen) of healthy fish may contain bacteria, but there is debate about whether or not muscle is actually sterile. Using traditional culture-dependent techniques, the numbers and taxonomic composition of the bacterial populations generally reflect those of the surrounding water. More modern culture-independent approaches have permitted the recognition of previously uncultured bacteria. The role of the organisms includes the ability to degrade complex molecules (therefore exercising a potential benefit in nutrition), to produce vitamins and polymers, and to be responsible for the emission of light by the light-emitting organs of deep-sea fish. Taxa, including Pseudomonas, may contribute to spoilage by the production of histamines in fish tissue.},

abstract = {In vertebrates, CD3 complex and CD4 and CD8 co-receptors are essential for signal transduction during T cell activation. In the present study, we report the mRNA spliced variants of the Atlantic salmon CD3$\epsilon$, CD4 and CD8$\beta$ and the effect of pathogen encounter on the expression of these variants. CD3$\epsilon$ is alternatively spliced in thymus, head kidney, spleen and gills to give rise to the complete mRNA sequence and to an alternative product that lacks the transmembrane exon. CD4 is also alternatively spliced in the thymus, head kidney, spleen and gills to form two variants, although the alternative product is barely detectable. The alternative product lacks the exon 1B encoding the D1 domain, which is essential for binding to MHC class II proteins. Two amplicons were also found for the CD8$\beta$ gene; sequencing analysis revealed that the main PCR product corresponds to the previously reported CD8$\beta$ sequence, whereas the variant sequence encodes a potential protein that lacks the Ig-like domain. The expression of CD3, CD4, CD8$\beta$ genes also analyzed in head kidney of LPS-treated and IPNV infected salmon and different patterns of expression were observed. The presence and balance of the different variants of T cell co-receptors could be related to the ability of fish to induce a particular type of immune response, as well as, the ability of the pathogen to modify the fish immune response.},

abstract = {Host defence peptides are found in all classes of life and are a fundamental component of the innate immune response. Initially it was believed that their sole role in innate immunity was to kill invading microorganisms, thus providing direct defence against infection. Evidence now suggests that these peptides play diverse and complex roles in the immune response and that, in higher animals, their functions are not restricted to the innate immune response. In in vitro experiments certain host defence peptides have been demonstrated to be potent antimicrobial agents at modest concentrations, although their antimicrobial activity is often strongly reduced or ablated in the presence of physiological concentrations of ions such as Na(+) and Mg(2+). In contrast, in experiments done in standard tissue culture media, the composition of which more accurately represents physiological levels of ions, mammalian host defence peptides have been demonstrated to have a number of immunomodulatory functions including altering host gene expression, acting as chemokines and/or inducing chemokine production, inhibiting lipopolysaccharide induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting wound healing, and modulating the responses of dendritic cells and cells of the adaptive immune response. Animal models indicate that host defence peptides are crucial for both prevention and clearance of infection. As interest in the in vivo functions of host defence peptides is increasing, it is important to consider whether in mammals the direct antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties observed in vitro are physiologically relevant, especially since many of these activities are concentration dependent. In this review we summarize the concentrations of host defence peptides and ions reported throughout the body and compare that information with the concentrations of peptides that are known have antimicrobial or immunomodulatory functions in vitro.},

abstract = {Innate immune factors play a crucial role in survival of young fish especially during early stages of life when adaptive immunity is not fully developed. In the present study, we investigated the immune response of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) larvae and fry at an early stage of development. We exposed 17 and 87° days post hatch larvae and fry (152 and 1118 degree days post hatch; avg. wt. 70 and 770 mg, respectively) to the bacterial pathogen, Yersinia ruckeri for 4h by bath challenge. Samples were taken at 4, 24, 72 and 96 h post exposure for qPCR and immunohistochemical analyses to elucidate the immune response mounted by these young fish. Larvae showed no mortality although infected larvae at 48 h post exposure showed hyperaemia in the mouth region and inflammation on the dorsal side of the body. Gene expression studies showed an up-regulation of iNOS and IL-22 in infected larvae 24h post exposure but most of the investigated genes did not show any difference between infected and uninfected larvae. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated a high expression of IgT molecules in gills and CD8 positive cells in thymus of both infected and uninfected larvae. Infection of rainbow trout fry with Y. ruckeri, in contrast, induced a cumulative mortality of 74\%. A high expression of cytokines (IL-1$\beta$, TNF-$\alpha$, IL-22, IL-8 and IL-10), acute phase proteins (SAA, hepcidin, transferrin and precerebellin), complement factors (C3, C5 and factor B), antimicrobial peptide (cathelicidin-2) and iNOS was found in infected fry when compared to the uninfected control. IgT molecules and mannose binding lectins in gills of both infected and uninfected fry were detected by immunohistochemistry. The study indicated that early life stages (yolk-sac larvae), merely up-regulate a few genes and suggests a limited capacity of larvae to mount an immune response by gene regulation at the transcriptional level. Based on the observed clearance of bacteria and lack of mortality it could be speculated that larvae may be covered by protective shield of different immune factors providing protection against broad range of pathogens. However, the increased susceptibility of older fry suggests that Y. ruckeri may utilize some of the immune elements to enter the naive fish. The up-regulation of iNOS and IL-22 in the infected larvae implicates an important role of these molecules in immune response at early developmental stages. A dense covering of surfaces of gill filaments by IgT antibody in the young fish suggest a role of this antibody as innate immune factor at early developmental stages.},

abstract = {Teleosts clearly have a more diffuse gut associated lymphoid system, which is morphological and functional clearly different from the mammalian GALT. All immune cells necessary for a local immune response are abundantly present in the gut mucosa of the species studied and local immune responses can be monitored after intestinal immunization. Fish do not produce IgA, but a special mucosal IgM isotype seems to be secreted and may (partly) be the recently described IgZ/IgT. Fish produce a pIgR in their mucosal tissues but it is smaller (2 ILD) than the 4-5 ILD pIgR of higher vertebrates. Whether teleost pIgR is transcytosed and cleaved off in the same way needs further investigation, especially because a secretory component (SC) is only reported in one species. Teleosts also have high numbers of IEL, most of them are CD3-ɛ+/CD8-$\alpha$+ and have cytotoxic and/or regulatory function. Possibly many of these cells are TCR$\gamma$$\delta$ cells and they may be involved in the oral tolerance induction observed in fish. Innate immune cells can be observed in the teleost gut from first feeding onwards, but B cells appear much later in mucosal compartments compared to systemic sites. Conspicuous is the very early presence of putative T cells or their precursors in the fish gut, which together with the rag-1 expression of intestinal lymphoid cells may be an indication for an extra-thymic development of certain T cells. Teleosts can develop enteritis in their antigen transporting second gut segment and epithelial cells, IEL and eosinophils/basophils seem to play a crucial role in this intestinal inflammation model. Teleost intestine can be exploited for oral vaccination strategies and probiotic immune stimulation. A variety of encapsulation methods, to protect vaccines against degradation in the foregut, are reported with promising results but in most cases they appear not to be cost effective yet. Microbiota in fish are clearly different from terrestrial animals. In the past decade a fast increasing number of papers is dedicated to the oral administration of a variety of probiotics that can have a strong health beneficial effect, but much more attention has to be paid to the immune mechanisms behind these effects. The recent development of gnotobiotic fish models may be very helpful to study the immune effects of microbiota and probiotics in teleosts.},

abstract = {The partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of the antimicrobial peptide reported in the present paper has been submitted to the TrEMBL database under the accession number P83338. A 6.7 kDa antimicrobial peptide was isolated from trout skin secretions using acid extraction followed by cation-exchange chromatography, (t)C(18) solid-phase extraction, and C(18) reversed-phase HPLC. The molecular mass of this peptide, which is tentatively named oncorhyncin III, is 6671 Da, as determined by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization MS. N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that the first 13 residues of oncorhyncin III are identical with those of the non-histone chromosomal protein H6 from rainbow trout. Hence these data combined with the MS results indicate that oncorhyncin III is likely to be a cleavage product of the non-histone chromosomal protein H6 (residues 1-66) and that it probably contains two methylated residues or one double methylation. The purified peptide exhibits potent antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the submicromolar range. The peptide is sensitive to NaCl, and displays no haemolytic activity towards trout erythrocytes at concentrations below 1 microM. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that oncorhyncin III does not cause direct disruption of bacterial cells. Reconstitution of the peptide in planar lipid bilayers strongly disturbs the membranes, but does not induce the formation of stable ion channels. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that oncorhyncin III plays a role in mucosal innate host defence.},

abstract = {Mammalian defensins are abundant antimicrobial peptides that contribute to host defense. They are characterized by several conserved amino acids, including six invariant cysteine residues which form three intramolecular disulfide bonds and stabilize the tertiary structure. Cryptdin-4 (Crp4), a mouse alpha-defensin with potent in vitro bactericidal activity, has a primary structure distinct from all known alpha-defensins in that its polypeptide backbone uniquely lacks three residues between Cys(IV) and Cys(V). NMR diffusion experiments showed that Crp4 is monomeric in solution, and its three-dimensional solution structure, determined by two-dimensional proton NMR, consists of a triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet with the beta-strands joined to each other by a series of tight turns and a beta-hairpin. However, the overall beta-sheet content in Crp4 is lower than that of other alpha-defensin structures, while the shape and orientation of the Crp4 beta-hairpin also differ from those of other alpha-defensin structures. These structural characteristics combined with the high overall cationicity of Crp4 may contribute to its broad bactericidal spectrum and membrane disruptive activity.},

abstract = {Defensins and cathelicidins are the two major families of mammalian anti-microbial proteins. They contribute to host, innate, anti-microbial defense by disrupting the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane. However, several members of the mammalian anti-microbial proteins including defensins and cathelicidins have been shown recently to have chemotactic effects on host cells. Human neutrophil alpha-defensins are chemotactic for resting, na\"{\i}ve CD45RA/CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and immature dendritic cells. Human beta-defensins are also chemotactic for immature dendritic cells but induce the migration of memory CD45RO/CD4 T cells. In contrast, cathelicidin/LL-37 is chemotactic for neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells but not for dendritic cells. Thus, these anti-microbial peptides have distinct, host-target cell spectra. The chemotactic activities of human beta-defensins and cathelicidin/LL-37 are mediated by human CC chemokine receptor 6 and formyl peptide receptor-like 1, respectively. The capacities of defensins and cathelicidins to mobilize various types of phagocytic leukocytes, immature dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, together with their other effects such as stimulating IL-8 production and mast cell degranulation, provide evidence for their participation in alerting, mobilizing, and amplifying innate and adaptive anti-microbial immunity of the host.},

abstract = {As global aquaculture fish production continues to expand, an improved understanding of how environmental factors interact in fish health and production is needed. Significant advances have been made toward economical alternatives to costly fishmeal-based diets, such as grain-based formulations, and toward defining the effect of rearing density on fish health and production. Little research, however, has examined the effects of fishmeal- and grain-based diets in combination with alterations in rearing density. Moreover, it is unknown whether interactions between rearing density and diet impact the composition of the fish intestinal microbiota, which might in turn impact fish health and production. We fed aquacultured adult rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fishmeal- or grain-based diets, reared them under high- or low-density conditions for 10 months in a single aquaculture facility, and evaluated individual fish growth, production, fin indices, and intestinal microbiota composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that the intestinal microbiotas were dominated by a shared core microbiota consisting of 52 bacterial lineages observed across all individuals, diets, and rearing densities. Variations in diet and rearing density resulted in only minor changes in intestinal microbiota composition despite significant effects of these variables on fish growth, performance, fillet quality, and welfare. Significant interactions between diet and rearing density were observed only in evaluations of fin indices and the relative abundance of the bacterial genus Staphylococcus. These results demonstrate that aquacultured rainbow trout can achieve remarkable consistency in intestinal microbiota composition and suggest the possibility of developing novel aquaculture strategies without overtly altering intestinal microbiota composition.},

abstract = {In the last few years, many cytokine and other immune related genes have been identified in different teleost species, thus allowing their study at a molecular level. However, very little is known about their effect on fish antiviral responses. In the current work, we have studied the effect of viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection on the expression of different immune genes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) through semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We have studied the effect of the viral infection on the expression of different cytokines such as interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), the CXC chemokine IL-8, and other immune genes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC II). The virus induced an increased transcription of IL-1beta in the spleen, and to a lesser extent in the head kidney and liver at early times post-infection. IL-8 transcription was also significantly induced with the virus in the spleen at early times post-infection. TGF-beta transcription was significantly induced in VHSV infection in the spleen and liver. In the spleen, a significant induction of TGF-beta at day 1 post-infection was observed. A further significant increase occurred in the spleen and liver at day 7 post-infection. No effect of the virus on MHC II expression was ever observed while iNOS was induced in the spleen, head kidney and liver of VHSV-infected fish mostly at day 7 post-infection. These results constitute a first step towards the understanding of which molecules may have a role in antiviral defence in fish.},

When the stressor is acute and short-term, the response pattern is stimulatory and the fish immune response shows an activating phase that specially enhances innate responses. If the stressor is chronic the immune response shows suppressive effects and therefore the chances of an infection may be enhanced. In addition, coping with the stressor imposes an allostatic cost that may interfere with the needs of the immune response. In this paper the mechanisms behind these immunoregulatory changes are reviewed and the role of the main neuroendocrine mechanisms directly affecting the building of the immune response and their consequences are considered.},

abstract = {Teleost fish represent a transition point on the phylogenetic spectrum between invertebrates that depend only on innate immunity and mammals that heavily depend on adaptive immunity. The major mechanisms of the teleost fish innate immune response are suggested to be similar to mammals, although fine details of the process require further studies. Within the innate immune response the type I interferon (IFN) system is an essential innate antiviral component that protects fish from some virus infections. The current progress of cloning and functional characterization of fish antiviral genes is promising in further elucidation of the fish antiviral response. The adaptive immune system of fish utilizes cellular components more or less similar to mammals. Teleost fish produce IgM as a primary antibody response and lack isotype switching to mount virus-specific antibodies during the infection process. Despite this, the development of successful fish rhabdoviral vaccines suggest that vaccination may prove to be an effective way of promoting fish adaptive immune responses to viruses. This paper reviews the bony fish antiviral response with specific discussion on the evolutionary mechanisms that allow aquatic viruses to co-exist with their host. Detailed aspects of the teleost type I IFN system are also addressed.},

To cover the demand for fish in the growing human population, continued high growth rates in aquaculture are needed. A potential constraint to such growth is infectious diseases, as disease transmission rates are expected to increase with increasing densities of farmed fish. Using an extensive dataset from all farms growing salmonids along the Norwegian coast, we document that densities of farmed salmonids surrounding individual farms have a strong effect on farm levels of parasitic sea lice and efforts to control sea lice infections. Furthermore, increased intervention efforts have been unsuccessful in controlling elevated infection levels in high salmonid density areas in 2009-2010. Our results emphasize host density effects of farmed salmonids on the population dynamics of sea lice and suggest that parasitic sea lice represent a potent negative feedback mechanism that may limit sustainable spatial densities of farmed salmonids.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial polypeptides (AMPPs) are increasingly recognized as a critical component of innate host defense. Among the AMPPs, polypeptides related to histones have been identified from many animals. Using peptide mapping, we further confirm the identity of two histone-like proteins from fish as members of the H2B (sunshine bass) and H1 (rainbow trout) histone groups. We optimized the conditions for measuring rainbow trout HLP-1/H2B via sandwich ELISA. We used two antibodies, one to the amino terminus and one to the carboxyl terminus, of trout histone H2B, as the capture antibodies, and we used peroxidase-labeled antibody raised to calf histone H2B as the secondary antibody. Specificity of the detecting antibody was confirmed by specific reactivity with histone H2B in tissue extracts via western blotting. The test was reproducible and capable of detecting as little as 5 ng of histone H2B (0.05 $\mu$g/ml). Histone H2B levels expressed in gill tissue of juvenile, healthy rainbow trout were well within concentrations that are lethal to important fish pathogens. However, there was a significant, age (size)-dependent decline in histone H2B concentrations as fish matured, until levels became virtually undetectable in market-size fish. In contrast, levels in skin appeared to remain high and unchanged in small versus large fish. Antibacterial activity in skin and gill tissues was closely correlated with histone H2B concentration measured via ELISA, which supports our previous finding that histones are the major AMPPs in rainbow trout skin and gill.},

abstract = {The innate immune system is a universal and ancient form of host defense against infection. Innate immune recognition relies on a limited number of germline-encoded receptors. These receptors evolved to recognize conserved products of microbial metabolism produced by microbial pathogens, but not by the host. Recognition of these molecular structures allows the immune system to distinguish infectious nonself from noninfectious self. Toll-like receptors play a major role in pathogen recognition and initiation of inflammatory and immune responses. Stimulation of Toll-like receptors by microbial products leads to the activation of signaling pathways that result in the induction of antimicrobial genes and inflammatory cytokines. In addition, stimulation of Toll-like receptors triggers dendritic cell maturation and results in the induction of costimulatory molecules and increased antigen-presenting capacity. Thus, microbial recognition by Toll-like receptors helps to direct adaptive immune responses to antigens derived from microbial pathogens.},

Six parasite species showed correlation between the host's total body length and prevalence and abundance. Host sex did not influence prevalence and parasite abundance of any parasite species. The mean diversity in the infracommunities of G. brasiliensis was H= 0.364 +/- 0.103, with correlation with the host's total length and without differences in relation to sex of the host. One pair of adult endoparasites (C. genypteri and A. brasiliensis) showed positive covariations between their abundances. Negative association or covariation was not found. Differences between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the parasite community of G. brasiliensis from Rio de Janeiro and Argentina suggest the existence of two population stocks of pink cusk-eel in the South America Atlantic Ocean.},

abstract = {Virus like particles (VLPs) against viral pathogens not only constitute a novel approach for the development of antiviral vaccines for an specific virus, but also for the creation of multivalent vaccines in which antigens from other pathogens may be expressed on the surface of these VLPs. Despite positive results on protection for many of these VLPs in both fish and mammals, not many studies have focused on the immune response triggered by these particles; studies that may provide hints for the identification of immune mechanisms responsible for antiviral protection, which are mostly unknown in fish. In the current work, we have studied the levels of transcription of several immune genes in the spleen of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) intraperitoneally injected with VLPs from infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) focusing on the chemokine response as well as the response of genes related to interferon (IFN) production. Surprisingly, the capacity of VLPs to induce chemokines differed from that of live IPNV, suggesting a direct effect of viral replication on the chemokine response in this organ. While VLPs up-regulated the transcription of CK3, CK10 and CXCd and down-modulated CK5B, CK6 and CK9 transcription, a previous study in which the transcription of $\gamma$IP, CXCd, CK1, CK3, CK5B, CK6, CK7A, CK9 and CK12 had been studied demonstrated that IPNV only significantly up-regulated CK6 and down-modulated CK3 in the spleen. On the other hand, the administration of VLPs produced a strong mobilization to the peritoneum of CD4(+), IgM(+), IgT(+) and CD83(+) leukocytes similar to that induced by the live viral infection. In both cases, this leukocyte recruitment seemed to be greatly mediated through CK3, CK5B, CK9 and CK10 chemokine production. These results together with the fact that VLPs strongly induced non-specific lymphocyte proliferation and specific anti-IPNV antibody production point to VLPs as excellent candidates for vaccine development.},

abstract = {Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric cytokine pivotal in resistance to microbial and viral infections. In the search for immunoregulatory genes in sea bass the genes for the two IL-12 subunits p40 and p35 were cloned and sequenced. Molecular characterization of these two genes was performed at both the cDNA and genomic levels. Sea bass IL-12 p40 and p35 conserve most cysteines involved in the intra-chain disulfide bonds of human IL-12 subunits as well as the important structural residues for human IL-12 heterodimerization. The gene organization of sea bass IL-12 p40 is similar to the human orthologue, whilst the sea bass IL-12 p35 gene structure, as reported for pufferfish, differs from the human one in containing an additional exon and lacking a second copy of a duplicated exon present in the mammalian genes. The promoter analysis of both sea bass and pufferfish IL-12 genes showed the presence of the main cis-acting elements involved in the transcriptional regulation of human and mouse orthologues. The involvement of IL-12 in sea bass anti-bacterial immune responses was demonstrated by investigating the expression profiles of IL-1beta, IL-12 p40 and p35 in the head-kidney and spleen following intraperitoneal injection of UV-killed and live Photobacterium damselae ssp. piscicida (Phdp). Finally, the importance of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB on UV-killed Phdp-induced IL-12 p40 and p35 gene transcription was shown by the use of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC).},

The developed assays were validated according to the assay validation criteria specified in the European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The detection limit and detection capability of the qPCR and ELISA were 100 copies of cry1Ab microL(-1) milk and 0.4 ng mL(-1) Cry1Ab, respectively. Recovery rates of 84.9\% (DNA) and 97\% (protein) and low (<15\%) imprecision revealed the reliable and accurate estimations. A specific qPCR amplification and use of a specific antibody in ELISA ascertained the high specificity of the assays. Using these assays for 90 milk samples collected from cows fed either transgenic (n = 8) or non-transgenic (n = 7) rations for 6 months, neither cry1Ab nor Cry1Ab protein were detected in any analyzed sample at the assay detection limits.},

abstract = {Although fish immunology has progressed in the last few years, the contribution of the normal endogenous microbiota to the overall health status has been so far underestimated. In this context, the establishment of a normal or protective microbiota constitutes a key component to maintain good health, through competitive exclusion mechanisms, and has implications for the development and maturation of the immune system. The normal microbiota influences the innate immune system, which is of vital importance for the disease resistance of fish and is divided into physical barriers, humoral and cellular components. Innate humoral parameters include antimicrobial peptides, lysozyme, complement components, transferrin, pentraxins, lectins, antiproteases and natural antibodies, whereas nonspecific cytotoxic cells and phagocytes (monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils) constitute innate cellular immune effectors. Cytokines are an integral component of the adaptive and innate immune response, particularly IL-1 beta, interferon, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta and several chemokines regulate innate immunity. This review covers the innate immune mechanisms of protection against pathogens, in relation with the installation and composition of the normal endogenous microbiota in fish and its role on health. Knowledge of such interaction may offer novel and useful means designing adequate therapeutic strategies for disease prevention and treatment.},

abstract = {The $\delta$-chain of catfish IgD was initially characterized as a unique chimeric molecule containing a rearranged VDJ spliced to C$\mu$1, seven C domain-encoding exons ($\delta$1–$\delta$7), and a transmembrane tail. The presence of cDNA forms showing splicing of $\delta$7 to an exon encoding a secretory tail was interpreted to indicate that membrane ($\delta$m) and secreted ($\delta$s) forms were likely expressed from a single gene by alternative RNA processing. Subsequent cloning and sequence analyses have unexpectedly revealed the presence of three $\delta$ C region genes, each linked to a $\mu$ gene or pseudogene. The first (IGHD1) is located 1.6 kb 3′ of the functional C$\mu$ (IGHM1). The second (IGHD3) is positioned immediately downstream of a pseudo C$\mu$ (IGHM3P), ∼725 kb 5′ of IGHM1. These two $\delta$ genes are highly similar in sequence and each contains a tandem duplication of $\delta$2-$\delta$3-$\delta$4. However, IGHD1 has a terminal exon encoding the transmembrane region, whereas IGHD3 has a single terminal exon encoding a secreted tail. The occurrence of IGHD3 immediately downstream of a $\mu$ pseudogene indicates that the putative $\delta$s product may not be expressed as a chimeric $\mu$$\delta$ molecule. Western blots and protein sequencing data indicate that an IGHD3-encoded protein is expressed in catfish serum. Thus, catfish $\delta$m transcripts appear to originate from IGHD1, whereas $\delta$s transcripts originate from IGHD3 rather than, as previously inferred, from a single expressed $\delta$ gene. The third $\delta$ (IGHD2) is associated with a pseudo C$\mu$ (IGHM2P); its presence is inferred by Southern blot analyses.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune responses in hybrid tilapia (Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus x Mozambique tilapia O. mossambicus) and Japanese eels Anguilla japonica after treatment with five glycans: barley, krestin, MacroGard, scleroglucan, and zymosan. The effects of the glycans on the innate immune responses of the fish were investigated using the phagocytic index (PI), lysozyme activity, complement opsonization, and activation assay. The results of the lysozyme assay demonstrated that the lysozyme activities increased after treatment with glycans. Moreover, based on the PI, treatment with each of the five glycans resulted in increased phagocytic activities in anterior kidney and peripheral blood phagocytes in both tilapia and Japanese eels. The opsonic effect of complement on phagocytosis in tilapia and Japanese eels were investigated using baker's yeast, which served as the activator in the classical complement pathway (CCP) and in the alternative complement pathway (ACP). Tilapia and Japanese eel sera that were treated with glycans greatly enhanced phagocytosis. The classical pathway--hemolytic complement titer (CH50) of Japanese eels treated with glycans was slightly increased in vitro and in vivo. While glycan treatment enhanced the CCP of both species in vitro and in vivo, the alternative pathway-hemolytic complement titer (ACH50) was only increased in vitro and in vivo in glycan-treated tilapia. Thus, it follows that the ACP must have been activated in tilapia treated with glycans. However, in Japanese eels, the ACH50 of the ACP activation assay was undetected in vitro or in vivo due to possible unknown factors in the Japanese eel serum that caused lysis of the rabbit red blood cells. Our study investigated the effects of glycans used to enhance phagocytosis and activate both of the complement pathways involved in stimulating the innate immune responses of Japanese eels and tilapia.},

abstract = {Genes encoding the five Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) cytokines; interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-11b, IL-12$\beta$c, and interferon (IFN) $\gamma$, were cloned and characterised at a molecular level. The genomic organisation of the halibut cytokine genes was similar to that seen in mammals and/or other fish species. Several mRNA instability motifs were found within the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of all cytokine cDNA sequences. The putative cytokine protein sequences showed a low sequence identity with the corresponding homologues in mammals, avian and other fish species. Nevertheless, important structural features were presumably conserved such as the presence, or absence in the case of IL-1$\beta$, of a signal peptide, secondary structure and family signature motifs. The relative expression pattern of the cytokine genes was analyzed in several halibut organs, revealing a constitutive expression in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. Interestingly, the gills showed a relatively high expression of IL-1$\beta$, IL-12$\beta$c and IFN$\gamma$. The real time RT-PCR data also showed that the mRNA level of IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-12$\beta$c and IFN$\gamma$ was high in the thymus, while IL-11b was relatively highly expressed in the posterior kidney and posterior gut. Moreover, the halibut brain showed a relatively high level of IL-6 transcripts. Anterior kidney leucocytes in vitro stimulated with imiquimod showed a significant increase in mRNA level of the five halibut cytokine genes. The sequence and characterisation data presented here will be useful for further investigation of both innate and adaptive immune responses in halibut, and be helpful in the design of vaccines for the control of various infectious diseases.},

abstract = {Despite the impressive increase in the cloning and expression of genes encoding fish immunoregulatory molecules, the knowledge on "in vivo" and "in vitro" functional immunology of the corresponding peptide products is still at an initial stage. This is partly due to the lacking of specific markers for immunoregulatory peptides, that represent an indispensible tool to dissect immune reactions and to trace the fate of cellular events downstream of the activation. In this review we summarise the available information on functional immune activities of some teleost species and discuss the obtained data in an evolutionary and applied context.},

abstract = {Cytokines are important regulators of immune system and finding these genes in fish have potential applications for the development of vaccines and or immunostimulants for aquaculture. Major hurdle in discovering cytokines from fish is the low identities of these molecules when compared to its mammalian counterparts. In fish, prior to pufferfish (Fugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome sequencing, only a handful of cytokines like IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, TGFbeta, some CXC (including IL-8) and CC chemokine genes were identified. Post genome release of pufferfish and zebrafish, the rate of discovery of fish cytokines has accelerated tremendously. Fish and human share a certain degree of synteny in genomes. Exploiting this characteristic, cytokines have been searched for in the genome databases of pufferfish (http://fugu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk) and zebrafish. Pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF's, IL-6 and IL-17 family have been cloned. A new TNF gene has been found adjacent to TNFalpha gene from fugu and zebrafish. Among the T(H)1 type interleukins, IL-2, IL-15, IL-12alpha, IL-12beta, IL-18 have been cloned. Among IL-10 and its family members, IL-10, IL-19/20, IL-22 and IL-26 have been discovered. Interferon genes have also been identified by from fish. However, T(H)2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13), IL-3, IL-7 and IL-9 are yet to be discovered from fish. This study shows that the type and diversification of fish cytokines are very similar to that found in mammals.},

abstract = {To determine whether fish intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) contribute to mucosal immunity, we established a method for isolating IECs from the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and examined cytokine production in these cells. Components of the intestinal epithelium were released by incubation of intestinal pieces with 1mM dithiothreitol (DTT)/ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). The IEC-rich fraction (purity >90\%; survival rate approximately 95\%) was obtained by centrifugation on a 35\%/40\% Percoll gradient, followed by magnetic cell sorting using an anti-trout IgM antiserum. The gene expression profiles of 14 cytokines in trout IECs were investigated after culturing the cells for 6h with or without the pathogenic bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida. Trout IECs could produce several cytokines, of which IL-1beta and TNFalpha2 were upregulated when the cells were stimulated with live A. salmonicida. Immunohistochemical analyses with the anti-trout TNF antibody confirmed that the TNF protein was present in the IECs of trout that were intra-anally challenged with live A. salmonicida. These results show that trout IECs are an important trigger of the intestinal immune system. Further, formalin-killed A. salmonicida, conditioned medium of this bacterium, or live nonpathogenic Escherichia coli could not upregulate the expression of these cytokines. These results indicate that the production of inflammatory cytokines by IECs is caused by the adhesion of A. salmonicida, but is not due to only simple ligand-receptor interactions between the surface molecules of IECs and the bacterium or in response to bacterial secretions.},

abstract = {Teleost fish are the most primitive bony vertebrates that contain immunoglobulins. In contrast to mammals and birds, these species are devoid of immunoglobulin A (IgA) or a functional equivalent. This observation suggests that specialization of immunoglobulin isotypes into mucosal and systemic responses took place during tetrapod evolution. Challenging that paradigm, here we show that IgT, an immunoglobulin isotype of unknown function, acts like a mucosal antibody. We detected responses of rainbow trout IgT to an intestinal parasite only in the gut, whereas IgM responses were confined to the serum. IgT coated most intestinal bacteria. As IgT and IgA are phylogenetically distant immunoglobulins, their specialization into mucosal responses probably occurred independently by a process of convergent evolution.},

abstract = {The current trend in world aquaculture is towards the diversification of cultures, mainly native species. The red cusk eel Genypterus chilensis is a native Chilean species of high gastronomic demand and seasonal exploitation that is projected as a candidate for the development of farming technology. The objective of this study was to test the efficiency of two incubation systems for G. chilensis egg masses, one with a closed water circuit (SICC) and the other with an open water circuit (SICA). Efficiency was measured by the percentage of eggs hatched. Two assays were performed, measuring and comparing the percentages of egg fecundation and hatching in four replicates between the two incubation systems. Significant differences were only found between the percentages of fecundation of bioassay 2. On average, in bioassay 1, egg fecundation reached 81\%, and the average of hatching for the SICC was 42.9 ± 34.5\% and for the SICA was 0.0 ± 0.0\%. Bioassay 2 had an average fecundation of 87.3 ± 2.6\% for the SICC and 79.8 ± 3.2\% for the SICA, and the average for hatching was 27.9 ± 33.7\% for the SICC and 4.8 ± 5.6\% for the SICA. Incubation parameters for maximum hatching were discussed and a proposal was made for improving the SICC system. The incubation system with a closed water circuit generated greater survival of G. chilensis eggs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the inflammatory process, chemokine CXCL8 plays a pivotal role in recruitment of human neutrophilic granulocytes. A diversity of sequences similar to CXCL8 was reported in fish, but their evolutionary relationships and functional homology with their human homolog remain unclear.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We screened fish genomes to seek for sequences related to CXCL8. A first lineage was retrieved in all teleosts, while a second CXCL8 lineage was found in zebrafish and carp only. An early inflammatory function for both lineages was indicated by several lines of evidence. The induction of carp CXCL8s, CXCb, and CXC receptor-1 and -2 was analyzed after in vitro stimulation of leukocyte subpopulations and in two in vivo inflammation models. Recombinant proteins of carp CXCL8 proteins were produced and showed significant chemotactic activity for carp leukocytes.

CONCLUSIONS: While both carp CXCL8s appear to be functional homologs of mammalian CXCL8, their different induction requirements and kinetics evoke a gene-specific sub-functionalization.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggested the probable involvement of an apical iron (Fe(2+)) transporter, the divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1), in the uptake of several divalent metals in fish. The present study examined the gastrointestinal expression of the DMT1 gene, and investigated the kinetics of Fe(2+) uptake and its interactions with cadmium and lead in isolated enterocytes of freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The expressions of two DMT1 isoforms (Nramp-beta and -gamma) were recorded along the entire gastrointestinal tract of fish as well as in the enterocytes. Fe(2+) uptake in isolated enterocytes was saturable and sensitive to the proton gradient and membrane potential, suggesting DMT1-mediated transport. Both cadmium and lead inhibited Fe(2+) uptake in isolated enterocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, and lead appeared to be a stronger inhibitor than cadmium. The kinetic characterization of Fe(2+) uptake revealed that the apparent affinity of uptake was significantly decreased (increased K(m)) in the presence of either cadmium or lead, whereas the maximum uptake rate (J(max)) remained unchanged-indicating that the interaction between Fe(2+) and cadmium or lead is competitive in nature. Overall, our study suggests that the uptake of dietary cadmium and lead may occur via the iron-transporting pathway in fish.},

abstract = {Animals have developed the means for supporting complex and dynamic consortia of microorganisms during their life cycle. A transcendent view of vertebrate biology therefore requires an understanding of the contributions of these indigenous microbial communities to host development and adult physiology. These contributions are most obvious in the gut, where studies of gnotobiotic mice have disclosed that the microbiota affects a wide range of biological processes, including nutrient processing and absorption, development of the mucosal immune system, angiogenesis, and epithelial renewal. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) provides an opportunity to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions through genetic and chemical screens that take advantage of its transparency during larval and juvenile stages. Therefore, we developed methods for producing and rearing germ-free zebrafish through late juvenile stages. DNA microarray comparisons of gene expression in the digestive tracts of 6 days post fertilization germ-free, conventionalized, and conventionally raised zebrafish revealed 212 genes regulated by the microbiota, and 59 responses that are conserved in the mouse intestine, including those involved in stimulation of epithelial proliferation, promotion of nutrient metabolism, and innate immune responses. The microbial ecology of the digestive tracts of conventionally raised and conventionalized zebrafish was characterized by sequencing libraries of bacterial 16S rDNA amplicons. Colonization of germ-free zebrafish with individual members of its microbiota revealed the bacterial species specificity of selected host responses. Together, these studies establish gnotobiotic zebrafish as a useful model for dissecting the molecular foundations of host-microbial interactions in the vertebrate digestive tract.},

abstract = {The use of immunostimulants has received increased attention due to the discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLR) or/and pattern recognition receptors (PRR). These receptors have been found to bind molecules from a range of pathogens including self-molecules. When cell damage has occurred many of the released molecular structures act as so-called "danger" signals possessing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP). These danger signals often consist of repeating molecular moieties yielding high molecular weight compounds. Examples are beta-glucans and CpG containing DNA, but some danger signals possess low molecular weight structures. It has been found that the PRR bind unit structures of PAMP, and that PAMP-binding involves several other humoral and cell membrane proteins, exemplified by the more or less simultaneous LPS recognition displayed by MD-2, CD-14 and TLR4 on the cell membrane. Also, the binding of beta-glucans has been shown to include several different cell membrane receptors. Several immunostimulants are commercially exploited in aquaculture as feed additives. This applies to beta-glucans, alginates and nucleotides. Despite their use as feed additives no targeted approach has been conducted to include PAMP as adjuvants in fish vaccines. Interestingly, most of the PAMP studied activate antigen-presenting cells together with na\"{\i}ve T cells into dendritic cells and Th1 or Th2 cells [1]. In turn, this may activate Th1 and Th2 immune responses with production of Th1 or Th2 signature molecules such as IFN-gamma and IL-4, respectively [2-4]. This review will mainly focus on binding characteristics of beta-glucans, their effects on T helper cell differentiation, effects on functional levels, gene expression profiles and application of the commonly used ss-glucan in the aquaculture sector. In addition, ss-glucans show promises in shrimp aquaculture by inducing disease resistance, this review will also highlight the use and the effects of beta-glucans in experimental models.},

@article{Gorgoglione2013,
abstract = {The myxozoan Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae is the causative agent of Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD) targeting primarily the kidney of infected fish where it causes a chronic lymphoid immunopathology. Although known to be associated with suppression of some cellular aspects of innate immunity and a prominent lymphocytic hyperplasia, there remains a considerable knowledge gap in our understanding of the underlying immune mechanisms driving PKD pathogenesis. To provide further insights, the expression profiles of a panel of innate/inflammatory and adaptive immune molecules were examined in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss following a natural exposure to the parasite. Relative to controls, fish with early to advanced stages of kidney pathology exhibited up-regulation of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-11, although remaining refractory towards genes indicative of macrophage activity. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and anti-inflammatory markers, including cathelicidin (CATH) and IL-10 were markedly up-regulated during clinical disease. Up-regulation of adaptive immune molecules, including cell markers and antibody genes reflect the lymphocytic dominance of this disease and the likely importance of lymphocyte subsets in PKD pathogenesis. Up-regulation of T helper (TH) cell-like response genes and transcription factors implies that T. bryosalmonae may elicit a complex interplay between TH cell subsets. This work, for the first time in the study of fish-myxozoan interactions, suggests that PKD pathogenesis is shaped by an anti-inflammatory phenotype, a profound B cell/antibody response and dysregulated TH cell-like activities. A better understanding of the functional roles of fish immune cells and molecules in PKD pathogenesis may facilitate future development of control measures against this disease.},

abstract = {Studies of innate immunity in fish species of special concern are essential for better understanding of their health status during hatchery rearing conditions. The cytochemical and morphological characterizations of blood granulocytes have been used to provide information about phylogenetic differences and determine the potential use of neutrophil function assays. Rapid, simple, cytochemical staining kits used routinely for staining mammalian granulocytes have been used to characterize granulocytes from blood of four fish species: Arctic grayling, cutthroat trout, June sucker, and shovelnose sturgeon. Blood smears were stained with Peroxidase 391 (myeloperoxidase, MPO), alkaline phosphatase (AP), Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) and Diff-quick stain; examined using bright field and differential interference contrast microscopy. Granulocytes on blood smears were evaluated based on the cell morphology, and presence or absence of the specific chromogen. Presence of lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets/thrombocytes and granulocytes was determined in all fish species. Arctic grayling, June sucker, and cutthroat trout had MPO positive granulocytes, while shovelnose sturgeon heterophils had positive reaction for leukocyte AP, but not MPO. Presence of MPO indicated potential to measure oxidative burst and degranulation of neutrophil primary granules in Arctic grayling, cutthroat trout and June sucker. Absence of MPO in shovelnose sturgeon suggested use of different enzyme marker (AP) in degranulation assay for this species. Standardization of cytochemical techniques allowed for rapid screening of leukocyte types, reducing the number of fish, time and effort to select adequate neutrophil function assays to be used in studies of health status in species of special concern.},

abstract = {The decline in the fisheries of traditional marine species has been an incentive for the diversification of today's aquaculture sector into the intensive rearing of many finfish species. The increasing interest in commercial farming of different finfish species is expected to result in similar environmental and husbandry-related problems as have been experienced in the development of the salmonid farming industry. An understanding of the biology of the fish species being cultured, in particular the immune response is important for improved husbandry and health management of the species. The innate immune system of fish has generated increasing interest in recent years and is now thought to be of key importance in primary defence and in driving adaptive immunity. This review focuses on key components (cellular and humoral) of the innate immune responses of different fish species of commercial importance.},
